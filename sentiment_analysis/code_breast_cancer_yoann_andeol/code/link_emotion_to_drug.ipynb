      "Hi @sukhbrar -Sorry to hear your Mom is going through chemo. Nice that you can be her support person.Unfortunately, diarrhea and/or constipation is very common with chemo. Everyone is different, but when I was on TC, the first week was the worst, the 2nd week I started feeling better and the 3rd week I felt pretty good, just in time to get ready for my next treatment. 🙄If you want to read more about people's experiences with TC, there is a thread devoted to it here:\n",

My first session did not go well. It dropped my sodium levels too low and I had a couple of seizures. They kept me in the hospital for two nights. I have been achey and weak since.  Does it get better? I don't know if I can do this! I am feeling very discouraged. I will be talking to my onc tonight, but I don't know if there are any alternatives. I'm trying to keep a positive attitude, but it is very hard. The hair comes off next week and I am depressed about that as well.  Also, did any one have problems with their finger nails? I heard that they can crack and come off. View PostView Post\n",

It\\'s wonderful to hear from you.  Tomorrow will be the 1 year anniversary of my lumpectomy.  I remember the uncertainty was crushing and I was just on the edge of tears most of the day before.  But I had the best BS, very kind and reassuring.  After the pathology came back and we learned I needed the full-Monty (chemo, radiation,  1 year of Herceptin and 5-10 years of AI), I remember coming here and finding this great group.  It was a long, hard winter of chemo, every Friday for 18 weeks with every 3rd Friday a full cocktail.  I was surprised by my reaction the other day as the weather got cold and I dropped my infinity scarf around my shoulders.  I wore it constantly last winter and my whole body shook as I was reminded of how rotten I usually felt when I was wearing it.  Now I\\'m looking at just 2 more Herceptin infusions and then port removal.  I hope to get it done before New Years when my deductible resets and I have to pay health bills again.  Thank goodness for insurance.  I\\'m having my first post TX mammo tomorrow and also getting some dental work done before I go on a bone strengthening drug.  I have only slight osteopenia, but the research is so strong for prevention of bone mets that my MO agreed to put me on it.  A rare side effect of the bone drug is osteonecrosis of the jaw; that\\'s why I\\'m getting the teeth up-to-code before I start.  I also started Anastrozole (AI) in June and may have to have that swapped out for another AI because of the bone pain side effect.  I\\'m on a 2-week \"vacation\" from the AI to see if the SE disappear and if they do, the MO will find a different AI for me.  We\\'re all so different in how these SE affect us.Mjb, is the drug you\\'re referring to Nerlynx?  I would be a candidate for it too, but my MO hasn\\'t started prescribing it yet because of the SE and because he\\'s conservative about jumping on new drugs.  I will be anxious to hear what your doc says.  I follow the Nerlynx thread on this board.  Hariry:  love your hair.  I think it compliments you very well.I hope we hear from some of our group that has gone quiet.  How are you all doing?', 'welcome Twinklemom. Hope your MRI went well! I also have headaches, thought to be due to anastrozole. Went away during week off, so oncologist did not think MRI necessary. Less painful with daily naproxen. We tried both other aromatase inhibitor’s, same thing. I think my brain just doesn’t like less estrogen.', 'anastrozole? That’s what I’ll take with the iBrance...not sure why I’m resisting starting  the iBrance but you all know I’m half crazy. No, 3/4 crazy...I took Femara for 3 1/2 years with no Side effects no problems nothing...I think I think too much...The newest issue this afternoon is Turkey Day...do we or don’t we? What’s anyone else planning? We’ve hosted every year for the past 35 but My son now lives 2+ hrs away, oldest daughter is here on and off(the one with TNBC), our youngest wants to have it here, on the patio with rented heaters...Seriously, is it worth going ahead? Oh, we’re also half Republican and half Democratic. Talk about dysfunctional. Half drinkers, half not. I think the best solution is to let my MO make the decision this year. It’s a tough one! It’s nice to be back in touch ❤️❤️❤️ Stay well everyone!', \"Minus two...as for checking blood work 24 hours after chemo...I remember having to go back a day after infusions to get the neulesta shot to boost white blood cells...was that your regimen?  I don't remember if they did blood test but I assume so...I was also told to take Claritin to reduce the bone pain from neulesta shot...it helps and 5 years later, I still take Claritin to help with SE of bone pain from anastrozole!  Best to all! Rosie\", \"OK this is word for word, what I sent my onco in the middle of the night last night. I was in self pity emo mode. Pretty sure I was crying when I type it:Hi. Dr. I would like to cancel my infusion appointment. I mean I can have my port flushed that day since it needs to be flushed but I am not comfortable doing infusion yet after my surgery.I still feel some pain in my liver. I actually had internal bleeding so I had to have an emergency surgery for that.I really feel like if I go through the infusion that it will split my liver in half.That's what I feel that is my decision. And I am willing to suffer the consequences I guess. I just feel like these cancer treatments just had me hospitalized twice now and this time I am listening to my gut.I will stop my infusion for now until I feel my liver is ready and fully healed.I am having trouble with insurance claims anyway.  I changed my insurance this year and it looks like the billing department did not process it right.There's just way too much going on. I just want to be free of pain and suffering from my recent hospitalization. And be worry free for awhile. Too much for me. I will continue the anastrozole but that's it.My cancer treatments are too traumatizing lately. I need a rest from it for awhile.The subject line - stopping kadcylaI just checked mychart today and my Dr. did reply. And wow surprised surprised, she agreed with my decision, My other decision is to remove my chemo port. I just cant afford to pay $800 a pop to flush it every 28 days! I will just wait til my next ultrasound appointment which I will have in May with my breast surgeon. And my onco also did tell me to wait till what the ultrasound result sees in my breast if I will be needing the port or not. I want to remove the port now but I literally have just been to surgery so…\", \"Pebblesv-  Thanks for your kind words. I had so wished that my onco score would have been low, but alas, that was not the case. I guess that I should be grateful for the onco test, because  if all of this happened to me 15 years ago, the standard of care would have just been lumpectomy and radiation. My tumor was small with no nodal involvement.  At least doing chemo lowered my risk statistically of recurrence, and for that I am grateful. Getting through chemo was rough, but I kept telling myself that all awful se's would be temporary.  I was grateful that I only needed to do 4 rounds.How are you doing on tamoxifen?  I am doing ok on anastrozole, but I have only been taking it since September. Blessings to all 😍\", \"My score was 51, I did 4AC and 12 taxol, it was doable, no major side effects, 20 rads, one bad burn which has now healed, my hair is coming back, grey as a badger but I'm well which is all that matters. I'm on Anastrozole and my fear ebbs and flows bit I have to get on with it. I'm 57.best of luck to you.\", 'I am wondering when a port is usually taken out after chemotherapy is complete? I can\\'t get a straight answer from my doctor, she just says we usually leave it in \"awhile\" every time I ask her. I finished TC chemo in December 2021 and am complete with all cancer treatments except for Anastrozole for the next 5 years. The port bothered me terribly (but worked OK) every time it was \"jiggled\". Now it doesn\\'t bother me anymore, but I\\'m not sure why it can\\'t be removed, or when it is usually to be removed. If you had a port for chemo and are done, when was your port removed?', 'Lauren—just anecdotally, it seems like Letrozole is the only AI I regularly read about hair impacts with. (I’ve been on Anastrozole for a year and haven’t noticed any.)', 'I’m now almost 8 weeks past my final TC treatment. I’ve finished my 21 radiation treatments 4 days ago, and have about 10 days ‘till I start back on my anastrozole hormone therapy. It has taken me a lot longer to regain energy than I expected. I didn’t realize that the Neulasta injections didn’t keep my WBC count high indefinitely, and was surprised that I still had low WBC at 5 weeks post chemo. I’m also somewhat anemic, though below what needs any treatment for now.  The MO explained that it takes a while for our bone marrow to recover, and that my blood counts aren’t unusual for the distance I am from chemo. Radiation was also a little different from my expectations. I had no skin changes until the final 9 treatments. I ended up with a large area of skin peeling and painful irritation underneath my breast in the inframammary fold. Also, mildly painful irritation in my axial fold (near where I had my lymph node removed). She prescribed Silver Sulfadine and lidocaine gel that I mixed with Aquafor, and 5 days later the pain is much better and my skin is looking better. I’m fatigued, and have had hot flashes, which I hadn’t realized can be triggered by radiation treatment. The other nice surprise I had was a terrible UTI. I have a long history of them, and before BC diagnosis was getting them about 4 times a year. I suspect that this one was with me for several weeks before my symptoms hit.  We need to remember that our suppressed immune system keeps us from showing normal symptoms. I felt so much better once I started antibiotics that I have a hunch that my asymptomatic UTI was a big reason for my fatigue. The day before I had symptoms, my blood pressure was abnormally low, and my pulse was high. I had shortness of breath. I’m grateful for the pain that finally told me to get checked.  I need to always remember to ask for a urinalysis if I’m fatigued. I’ve been feeling a lot better over the last few days now. Was able to prepare a couple of nice Instant Pot meals (lemon asparagus risotto and caprese chicken one night and buffalo chicken wraps another) along with peach cobbler using fruit from a local orchard. I’ve been able to enjoy sewing my quilt block of the month, and can actually do a full grocery shopping run without crashing afterwards. I think that once the weather cools just a bit more I’ll be able to resume walking. For follow up, I am doing Signatera.  I was unsurprised, but disappointed that I’ll be paying for it myself since my insurance declined the pre approval request.  I think they just need more evidence that there’s a benefit to early detection of circulating cells that match my tumor genes. If there is one big complaint I have it’s that we don’t really look beyond the breast in early BC treatment. How do we know the treatment we have worked? Waiting for obvious symptoms of recurrence frankly just sucks.  In lighter news, I’ve got an appointment to trim my remaining hair. Cold capping was successful for me, though I did lose a lot of my normally thick hair. I don’t need to do anything to look reasonably normal in public other than make sure I’m within 2 days of washing my hair.  I’m thinking the anastrozole I was taking prior to chemo set me back somewhat. I’m now seeing some hair growth on my legs.  I even had to annihilate a few chin hairs. Why did they have to be among the first to pop up?   Anyhow, I agree with ajbclan, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and even a couple of months after chemo, the light is poking through.', \"Nel, how is your rotator cuff?

I haven't done the second opinion, yet.  I'm going to wait til I get Medicare and supplement sorted out.  Medicare starts July 1, I have my drug plan, now it's just a matter of the supplement.  I'll probably call my onco next week and let him know I'm off the drug.  I'm supposed to see him in October, but he may not have me come in.  I finished physical therapy Friday.

I just had my mammogram and all was still good, so I'm happy about that.  This past year's check up, my oncologist put me on Boniva for bone loss from the anastrozole.  It's not too bad except that I have to take it first thing in the morning and wait an hour before eating or drinking anything else.  And I am fond of my morning cup of coffee, so that is rough.  I'm also supposed to stay upright, not lying down or relaxing in a chair, so I usually go for a long walk after taking it.  That works out well because it kind of gets my mind off the coffee I'm missing, but at least it is only once a month to take it.  I hope everyone is enjoying the fall weather.

I am glad that you are trying to distance yourself from that stress in your life. I don't think we should waste a minute of this time we have left worrying over things like that.  I was worried that I may be getting inflammatory breast cancer a while back.  I have several of those symptoms, and I was a little worried that my upcoming mammogram wouldn't catch it.  But the bruise that I was most worried about has gone away now and the other symptoms have been there a long time, so I am feeling better about that. I will  ask the doctor who sees me when I get the mammogram the end of this month, and hopefully he can reassure me. Like you I have been on the anastrozole so long that I don't know if I will feel better when I stop taking it or if my age is part of it by now too. It is hard to say.

The bacterium produced a natural red pigment, like beets are naturally colored. It was found to be a powerful treatment against tumors, and even today, it's one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agent ever developed. A gift from nature, whose purpose is to kill cancer. I had six round of TAC chemo (taxotere, adrimycin, cyclophosphamide). I tolerated it well. A couple of days after each round, I started feeling achy and tired, and my head felt like it was stuffed with wet cotton. Like having the flu, without the cough and fever. This lasted just a few days, and then I was fine to go back to work at my administrative desk job. What I believe helped me get through chemo with relative ease was being determined to stay active. Every day, I walked or rode my bicycle. Getting out in fresh air and moving your body is like a prescription for feeling better.I had zero nausea. None. I was given a couple of IV drugs during chemo that prevented nausea, and I had a boatload of Zofran pills at home. That first round I took my Zofran round the clock, but I found that I didn't really need it much during subsequent rounds. Some people notice their nails turn dark.  I didn't notice this, but I was surprised to find a couple of dark spots on my backside where my bicycle saddle hits. I was warned, fortunately, that adriamycin will turn urine kinda red for a couple of days. Don't wear your favorite panties until the color clears. It's not blood.I agree with all here who urge you to not just suffer through side effects. If you're uncomfortable in any way, call your oncologist.

That year at SABCS, Dr. Jones and colleagues reported that, among more than 1,000 women, those who took a Taxotere/Cytoxan combination had a lower rate of relapse than those on the standard treatment. ...The favorable trend toward a non-anthracycline alternative has continued in 2007. This year, Dr. Jones, based at the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, and colleagues reported that seven years after treatment, women who received the non-anthracyline treatment have a better survival rate in general, as well as survival without cancer recurrence, something that has not been found in previous studies. At the end of this analysis, 87 percent of women who took the non-anthracycline regimen were alive, compared with 82 percent of those receiving the standard treatment. ...Meanwhile, further studies described during the [2007 SABCS] meeting are trying to determine which women should remain with anthracyclines, and which could use an alternative. Anthracyclines target a particular enzyme, called topoisomerase, or TOPO II. Therefore, if a tumor isn\\'t drawing on this enzyme for growth, there would be little need for an anthracycline drug. This may be the case for the vast majority of breast cancers, says Dennis Slamon, MD, PhD, of UCLA\\'s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. During the meeting, he described studies that tried to tease out the influence of HER2 status in cancer treatment. They found that in some women the HER2 overexpression works in tandem with TOPO II leaving the tumor extremely vulnerable to the anthracycline drug. However, they did not find any instance of a HER2-negative tumor that also relied on TOPO II. If this analysis holds, Dr. Slamon argues, it would mean that more than 90 percent of breast cancers have no target for anthracycline drugs. He also believes the studies that have found a benefit for anthracyclines have not accounted for whether the benefit is confined to those tumors that are HER2 positive, enlisting TOPO II as an accomplice. ...\"+++++++I\\'ve read some of the original papers to which the \"Cure Today\" article refers.\\xa0 I didn\\'t find them until after my onco had approved TC and I had started chemo.\\xa0 They make me glad I chose that option.otter', 'I am so confused!!!!

For instance, on an AC-T protocol, the adriamycin and cyclophosphamide will certainly cause hair loss, prompting many women like you to opt for the cold cap. But those two drugs do not typically cause peripheral neuropathy. And, as parakeets rule points out, the neuropathy some experience with taxol often abates with time.  AC can, infrequently, cause hand and foot syndrome, resulting in blisters. But it is rare, and if you did develop it you could ice the hands and feet on subsequent sessions. Also, not certain, but I believe to get full benefit you need to have feet and hands cold before they infuse the chemo.Have you discussed icing with your oncologist, to get their recommendation?

I had a hypersensitivity reaction almost right away- got super flushed, felt tightness and heaviness on my chest and difficulty breathing, pain in stomach and back.

The worst side effect of this chemo is the bone and joint pain. I had some with the other chemo that would flare when I did too much but this is worse and constant. Thankfully my team prescribed me something to manage it. My mouth and throat are also more dry and sore and it affects my taste more this round. 2 more rounds to go.

November 17 begins infusion one of TC (Docetaxel + Cytoxan).  I've been reading up on how others faired with this treatment.  Wishing to be one of the lucky ones with few side effects. The cancer center (I'm in Fairfax, VA) will have cryotherapy mittens and boots, which I plan to use to offset neuropathy (hopefully) and I will use a DigniCap cold cap to hopefully preserve some hair.

I didn't expect to need chemo either and in some respects it still feels like a dream.  I have my first infusion of TC (Docetaxel/Taxotere and Cytoxan/Cyclophosphamide) on Wednesday.  It will be a long day as I'm doing cold capping that will continue for two hours after the chemo infusions are over.   I had my port placed on Friday afternoon.  I was really wigged out about it - guess I did to much research prior!  I told the doctor and anesthesiologist  that I didn't want to know anything that was happening or remember anything after it was over.  And I didn't.  I was tired from the anesthesia but felt no pain until the next morning.  Even then, some ice and Tylenol kept the pain at bay.  Day 3 and I'm just feeling some soreness at the incision site.  But I know having this port will be so much better than getting infusions in my 65 year old veins!  LOLI was SO worried about this port, and I would tell anyone who needs a port and has the same fears, just do it.  Make sure you tell them you want to be knocked out as much as possible.  You'll deal with a little  pain, then soreness and a slight tugging feeling. But it is all very manageable.  I I did not think it would be from the get go!   I really took it easy for the last two days. You can't lift more than 10 pounds for 7 days after port placement.

However, they differ at two positions:(1) The nature of the substituent \"R1\" (at the very top, center); and(2) The nature of the substituent \"R2\" (located just above the inset box).For the actual substituents at those positions, see the inset box, which identifies what R1 and R2 are in each compound.BarredOwl', 'There is a 2015 article  that examines the difference in efficacy and side effects between Taxotere and Taxol titled \"Balancing activity and tolerability of neoadjuvant paclitaxel- and docetaxel-based chemotherapy for HER2-positive early stage breast cancer: Sensitivity analysis of randomized trials\".  I  don\\'t know if the study is considered good evidence or not.In the end, I chose Taxotere (which followed an anthracycline) over Taxol.  Taxotere carries a greater risk of permanent hair loss, while Taxol puts the patient at risk of neuropathy (neurotoxicity).  I figured that I would rather be permanently bald than in permanent pain.   My mother developed permanent neuropathy from Taxol and she really suffers from it. Here is the abstract (if anyone wants the rest of the article, please PM me):\"Paclitaxel and docetaxel represent the most adopted taxanes in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Questions still remain with regard to their difference in terms of activity and tolerability. Events for pathological complete response (pCR), severe and febrile neutropenia (FN), and severe neurotoxicity were pooled by adopting a fixed- and random-effect model. A sensitivity analysis to test for the interaction between paclitaxel and docetaxel was accomplished. Absolute differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the number of patients needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) were calculated to derive the Likelihood of being Helped or Harmed (LHH). Data from 15 trials (3601 patients) were included. Paclitaxel significantly increases pCR rate by 6.8% in comparison with docetaxel (43.4%, 95% CI 41.1–45.7% versus 36.6%, 95% CI 34.3–39.0%, p = 0.0001), regardless of the chemotherapy backbone, with an absolute difference of 9% and 9.2% for anthracy- cline-based or free-regimens. Paclitaxel significantly improves pCR versus docetaxel with a single HER2-inhibition by 6.7% (p = 0.0012), with no difference if combined with a dual HER2-inhibition. Severe neutropenia and FN are significantly lower with paclitaxel, with an absolute difference of 32.4% (p < 0.0001) and 2.5% (p = 0.0059), respectively. Conversely, severe neurotoxicity is slightly higher with paclitaxel (3%, p = 0.0001). The LHH ratio calculated for pCR and severe neutropenia is 2.0 and 0.7 for pac- litaxel and docetaxel. Although the activity of neoadjuvant paclitaxel and docetaxel HER2-positive breast cancer is considered similar, the slight advantage in pCR, the significantly lower neutropenia and FN, do favor paclitaxel (in the weekly fashion) over docetaxel, despite the slightly worst neurotoxicity.\"', 'Thanks for sharing that, Cowgirl13.

I asked if my neoadjuvant chemo was adequate. She said there may be some additional benefit to do Adriamycin treatments (4 cycle). But since I did not have a super great response to TCx4, additional chemo may not be that helpful. She told me their cancer board discussed it, but no consensus ( probably majority said no more chemo). There is not enough data to support either way, so in the end she basically said \" You are young and healthy otherwise.

I just had my BMX two days ago, and am happy to report that I really felt recovered from the chemo before this new ordeal for my body. Even my resting heart rate had returned to normal (it had been elevated during the TC treatment).My eyebrows are just starting to grow back, as is the hair on other parts of my body. I used the Paxman cold cap on my head, so I never became fully bald, but my husband said today that he thinks maybe there's some new growth on my head where I do have bald spots. That said, my old long hair is still coming out a bit... Overall, I think I lost about 60 percent of the hair I had - maybe even more. But because I started with curly hair, it kindof filled in the gaps so that my wide headbands made it look like I wasn't a cancer patient, and I really appreciated that.After I recover from surgery, I'll go back on the letrozole, but my surgeon doesn't think there is a big hurry for that. She thinks I should give my body the best chance to recover by not putting new drugs in the mix right now. Maybe I'll wait until July.My surgical pathology from the BMX was good news, too. I had some LCIS and ALH (this was expected, and was the reason I opted for the surgery), but no additional invasive cancer. So, I'm really hopeful that this will be the end of my major breast cancer treatment, and that I can go on to live my life without worrying too much about it (other than the letrozole and associated side effects).I guess my experience with TC chemo was that it sucked, but for me it was manageable and my body recovered in about 5 weeks PFC.

Hair grew back somewhat curly ( I loved that!) but much thinner than before.  I ditched the wig at about 6 months PFC (feel ignorant not to know what those initials stand for???).  My curls were all cut off in only a few months.  Here is the problem: my hair in the last month has started thinning. I think it may be from the letrozole which I started taking 11 months ago.  I am afraid I will have to return to a wig if this shedding does not stop. Its okay on sides and back but patchy now on top. So to me all of the pictures of thick curly hair are beautiiful!  Persevere.  Polly', 'PollyPFC is post final chemo!!’🤣. I’m sorry to hear about your thinning. So discouraging considering you had a lovely thick head of hair prior to this.  I feel like those on Letrozole complain a lot of hair thinning. I remember my oncologist gave me option to switch to it, and I said “no thanks I’ll suffer on Arimidex a bit longer”. Because I was scared of thinning hair. Not that your hair can’t thin on Arimidex!  Hoo boy! I supplement heavily. biotin, B complex, amla, calcium and D3.  That reminds me, when I had low D level my hair really thinned.  Important to have that checked regularly for many reasons but hair!  Polly good luck, let us know how you fare!!KC', 'CBK Thank you for your advice.  Alas I have been taking 5000mg of biotin every day for over a year as well as B12 with folic acid.  So I really don\\'t think that a lack of B vitamins is my problem.  Met with MO today to discuss this. I will have my D levels checked at my regular appt in May. We agreed I will take a month to 6 week \"vacation\" from letrozole and see if my hair stabilizes.  If it doesn\\'t we\\'ll know its not the med.  If it does stabilize, I will switch to Arimidex and see how it goes.  I am at peace about it because we also discussed more fully that the basal property of my tumor probably means that even though I am 95% estrogen positive, no aromatase inhibitor will have any positive effect for me with respect to lowering my risk of recurrence.  In other words I am like someone with TNBC in that  chemo is the only treatment that has a chance to help.   People like me with basal like bc (BLBC) have some expression or over expression of an element that blocks aromatase inhibitors.  Its complicated but maybe my explanation is close enough.  Going to have a Dexa scan and if my bones have deteriorated in the last year then I may stop taking any med.  Polly', 'My previous post raises the question of why as a BLBC patient I am taking letrozole to start with.  This is because some of the studies about BLBC apparently dealt with Stage IV and I am Stage II.  So the thinking was  maybe, just maybe, letrozole would have some protective property for me and I might as well throw the kitchen sink at my cancer.  Not much is known about my kind of cancer. If my understanding is correct about 15% of ductal cancer is TNBC and of that 15% about 25% are BLBC with estrogen positive -- i.e., less than 4%.  So bottom line: might as well take it and hope for the best.  Polly', 'Oh wow Polly-Well I’m glad you received some clarity of where you are going and what you are dealing with. I’m glad you are getting a break to see what it brings considering the circumstances. Nobody has mentioned much to me about specifics of my extremely high er+ markers. I was basically told if I go off an al. it would be an extremely bad thing for me and I just took for granted. Nothing scientific but my observation is that Letrozole patients that I know do seem to complain more about hair loss than other Al users. I don’t know why one would reek more damage on the hair than another. After all they are all making us drop estrogen so they would seem to be equal in attacking our locks. Hope your scans come back positive.', 'CBK - To clarify, I am having a bone density scan, not a bone scan for mets. Positive for me will be that density has not suffered in the last year due to the letrozole. Perhaps that is what you meant all the time. Interesting that you  bring up the question whether letrozole is worse for hair than Arimidex.  Posters on this forum  -- well, some of them -- believe that letrozole is worse for hair and Arimidex is worse for neuropathy so I asked my MO today about it.  He says that his patients who have changed report no difference in side effects. I am skeptical of this. I tend to believe the posters because I know I don\\'t talk about all my side effects and suspect many women do not either so doctors don\\'t know how we are affected. But I did ask the specific question whether letrozole was \"stronger\" than Arimidex based on the fact that MOs use letrozole for Stage IV patients.  What he said makes sense: no there is no difference in strength. The reason letrozole is used for Stage IV is because  companion drugs like Ibrance were tested with letrozole (drug co. had to limit to one AI to keep variables limited for research purposes) and perhaps that drug co. manufactured letrozole as well as the companion drug being tested.  So MOs used what the testers had used.  Makes sense to me.  I will report back after my letrozole \"vacation\" and report whether my hair stabilized.  Keep a good thought of me.

How nice to hear from some of you. Life is definitely strange on the other side. I was cruising along on Letrozole and zoladex and was going to have a minor revision to my implants before year end. PS perforated my colon during liposuction. I ended up in the ER with emergency surgery. Spent 9 days in the hospital. I am home now with an open wound on my abdomen and a wound vac. It will take 6 weeks for it to heal. I swear if it was going to be a complication it was going to happen to me. But this one almost killed me. I was going to have my ovaries out in January, but NO MORE surgery for me. I have been put under 7 times this year. I am done.

Sounds very exiting! I'm stage 4 - liver mets - that seem to be very aggressive at the moment. Ibrance/Faslodox (and before that Letrozole) failed me. Now moving to weekly taxol - no ending (so not a 8-round chemo). Until it stops working, onc. says. Never had any chemo before so quite scarred of the prospect. I will definitely try fasting 36-48 hours before and 24 hours after infusion. Just a little worried that it is every week - so will be kind continuous 3-4 fasting. And don't know how long this is going to be possible. Please keep writing about your experiences as you go along. And if there are stage 4 on weekly taxol out there fasting - please kick in too!\", 'Hi! How is everyone doing who has started with aromatase inhibitors?

I miss hugs from my grand children and friends the most. My MO put me on letrozole it's not that bad, have some joint pain sometime, but WOW the hot flashes at night are intense. Like wake up go get a towel and dry off intense. Just something else we have to deal with.  I have my scar revision surgery scheduled for July 16, had to put it off due to no elective surgery's in April or May and July was the soonest it could be scheduled.

After two months  I could not take it anymore so I bought some henna and colored it with it.  Now its a nice shade of auburn. That was the color of my hair when I was young, it had gotten darker over the years. The henna worked out great, but goodness is it messy, it says it will last four to six weeks, we will see.

I’ve always been cold natured; but this past winter was worse than usual.  I actually bought a portable heater, positioned it to blast right at me, and carried it from room to room.  When I mentioned that I thought the chemo impacted my body temp, I was met with a blank stare.   Now fast forward to summer... I sweat like crazy (water running down my face, off my (now) short hair.  And the creepy-crawling skin!  When I’m hot, my skin feels so strange.

I just checked in since a month ago and saw you just posted. Sorry to hear your implants were not the best or causing a bubble reaction. Reconstruction has to be difficult to perfect. It sounds like your plastic surgeon is going to try and make it better with a different kind. Best of luck with your surgery. When is your surgery?My lumpectomy was pretty bad. The nipples are still not evenly matched, and the corrective surgery only got rid of the pointiness I had on the cancer side. That was good, but he made my good side a bit too small. I need to wear a padded bra to make them even as the unpadded bras gap on the smaller side.  Now I wish he hadn\\'t touched it. I guess I\\'ll just be deformed for the rest of my life. If I were younger, I\\'d be really mad. Medicare won\\'t cover anymore surgery for sure and I\\'m too tired to face more surgery.  The only excuse I get is “at least you\\'re alive\". Well that\\'s true, but it\\'s still sloppy surgery. I can\\'t understand why after the complaints I made about the nipples being an inch off that he couldn\\'t have tucked the droopy one up higher by tucking the skin. He just didn\\'t place it right originally. I also have a huge hard two inch lump on the cancer side that is scar tissue and it\\'s very sensitive. Oh well, I just try to forget this mess.

I’m under Medicare which makes you pay 20% of surgery unless you have capped out on your out of pocket co pays. So I doubt I’d be covered 100%. I don’t qualify for supplemental insurance because of having heart disease, and now cancer disease here in FL.

Hugs and Happy Thanksgiving right back to you. (Ours is next month.)SO much has happened in the last three years. I struggled with tamoxifen, had some side effects, then had to stop it entirely. After a complete hysterectomy (best decision ever and not sure why I waited so long for that), I started Letrozole. This has been better for me, still with side effects but doable so far. However in the meantime my MO moved and the new one (who is great) has put me into the 10 year club for AIs. I am determined to stick with it, so I have a routine of daily Prilosec, Aleve, Calcium chews, and lots of water. New MO says that my recurrence risk is 17% without the Letrozole, so onward I go with all of this. I've bought a treadmill and am walking more. I will also add that the pathology report from my hysterectomy explained lot of the pain I've had for YEARS. I don't know why so many doctors are reluctant to suggest a hysterectomy when it's appropriate.  My next MO appointment is Monday and I'm hoping I can stay with Letrozole for now.

After that last set of 3 aspirations, I felt another lump on my non cancer breast. I had a bilateral reduction and this lump was at the end of one of the scars. So the doctor ordered an ultrasound and a biopsy was recommended. While waiting the 2 weeks for the biopsy I felt 2 more lumps. Returned for another u/s, and they added those to the biopsies. I had one cyst aspirated and 3 areas biopsied with clips placed. All came back as benign scar tissue from surgery. So now what do I do if I feel more lumps? Lather, rinse, repeat?Meanwhile, I've been taking the letrozole/femara. Side effects are fatigue and muscle aches, pretty bad muscle aches. So I called my MO to ask how much muscle pain I should tolerate. He told me to stop taking it, wait for aches to subside, then we'd discuss other drug options. My adventure continues.

I’m supposed to start my zometa infusions in early April. I’m not looking forward to it. I’ve read there are some potential nasty side effects (like the jaw bone can basically disintegrate and cause teeth to come loose) and that the bone density you gain while taking the drug goes away as soon as you stop.

I finally got my hip replaced as well in November.  I was scheduled for the surgery when I was diagnosed last March and had to put it off.   It was very painful.  I started the Letrozole but it hurt my hip so badly I had to wait till it was replaced and restart.  I also turned 70 in November.  My SE's are mostly pain in shoulders, hips and low back which so far is tolerable.   Sleep is difficult because my body hurts.  I am back to being pretty active so maybe that is why I'm sore as well.  I'm playing pickleball again a few times a week which makes me so happy.  What time of day do you take the Letrozole?  I take mine at bedtime but thinking maybe I should try it in the morning.  I have not been told about Zometa yet.  I hope it all works smoothly and does what it's supposed to do.  Happy for your clean mammogram!@sarahjunefox Hope your mammogram went well!  I am having my first this week as well with only one boob, still can't believe it sometimes.   I am also going to address reconstruction now.  When I had the mastectomy there was concern because I had radiation on that breast when I was young.

DLcygnet At the end of January, I had my tubes and ovaries removed by laparoscopic day-surgery, because of a scary (but luckily benign) growth on one ovary. The procedure was done under general anesthesia, starting around noon; I was able to go home just after 7PM the same day (they don't let you go until you pee   ). I came home with 4 incisions - two very tiny ones on either side of my lower abdomen (one stitch each); a vertical one-inch at my naval which would have also been itsy bitst except they found the start of a hernia there and kindly fixed it because they had to make the hole anyway for one of the instruments. The largest incision was made in my old C-section scar, just left of the midline. That one is an inch and a half, because the growth was large and that's where they took it (and tubes and other ovary) out. I had the option said no, because it wasn't giving me any trouble. Recovery was easy, tylenol/codeine for the first 3 nights, otherwise just tylenol. No lifting heavier than 1kg = a full quart milk carton for one  week, no pilates or other sit-ups exercise for 2 weeks. Stitches were self-dissolving.Overall, the surgery and recovery were much less stressful/uncomfortable than I expected. I had already gone through menopause about a year before my breast cancer, and am taking AIs (letrozole), so no change in those symptoms, which for me have been mild anyway.If you are considering getting your ovaries out to prevent ovarian cancer, I'd suggest getting both plus tubes out. Leaving one ovary in wouldn't change cancer risk (to my knowledge). And leaving your uterus in would prevent possible urinary incontinence later (not very common but still a side effect of uterin removal).I hope this helps, and I hope if you decide to get the surgery, that all goes well\", \"My yearly controlss were switched last year from the hospital cancer clinic to the community health center, I guess because at 5 yrs everything was ok. Had trouble getting an appointment, so I got the usual bloodwork done privately (this lab doesn't require a doctor's order slip). Aaaaand: my AFOS is up, almost three times what it used to be all through treatment controls, and definitely out of the normal range. I'm scared. Luckily I finally succeeded in getting a health center doctor appointment for next week; repeated the bloodwork this morning. Crossing fingers this is just a false alarm...   update Sept. 15:My AFOS was repeated through the public health center, and although not as low as it used to be, it is just within normal limits. The doctor was not concerned, so I'm going to try to stop worrying, since I feel ok (except for tired). She wanted me to restart Fosavance for as long as I take letrozole. I have to go in for mamm/ultrasound, but am not worried, no lumps\", \"I can't believe it's been 7 years since my diagnosis. When this all started, I didn't expect to make two years, let alone seven. But so far, no recurrance. A few scares - most recently getting ovaries and tunes removed because of a scary cyst, that luckily turned out to be not cncer. Am followed by a generalist at the health center now; the hospital oncology clinic transferred my care after my 5-yr-check-up was normal. I'm very strongly considering stopping the letrozole at the end of the year, instead of continuing for the original ten. Nowadays most women here are only put on estrogen blockers for five years. Breast cancer treatments have changed so much since 2015 - new drugs, new treatment schedules!

Had delayed getting the study, because I was so scared it would mean another bout with cancer, and I honestly didn't think I could handle that.

I\\'m not sure if anyone is still checking the board or not, but thought I would say hi and ask how everyone is doing? Things here (outside of covid) are pretty much back to normal. I also went through a divorce, it started after chemo and mastectomies and before radiation.  He was nice enough to send me a note after radiation treatment to let me know \"he knew I could do it.\" Enough time has now passed that I can almost laugh and roll my eyes at that comment lol! I am on letrozole still, but I only take it 3 to 4 times a week to help reduce the painful joint side effects. It has also been quite hard on my hair.

Your Dr. really jumped the gun on that call.  I do think she could have handled it better.  Letrozole sends me off the deep end.  Not only do I get suicidal thoughts I get aggressive.

The day before surgery, bleeding had resumed, totally like period - even though blood test end of September had confirmed that I was postmenopausal - had been for 3 years since chemo.

This made me question the effectiveness of the monthly shots, and whether the letrozole was effective during the past 2 months of actual long not being in menopause...

I’m on Letrozole, and I think some of my “issues” are from that.   I am often very fatigued and have bone and joint pain.  I think I have sort of been waiting until I felt better to really get more active. Now I’m taking a new approach and forcing myself up and outside.  I have read the longterm prognosis is much more positive for women with great muscle mass and not overweight.  During the chemo/surgery/radiation/chemo phases I was t thinking about what was “next” ...just doing what was right in front of me.  So, my new take on my current problems is to do the same thing and do the right/best next thing.  I don’t like those Xeloda commercials which day “she found her new normal” but now, after all these months I’m having to accept that this truly is the new normal and I just have to play the hand I’ve been dealt....one day at a time.  💕💕💕', \"Hi Chelsea and buttonsmachine, very glad to hear from you both. Hormonal therapy definitely has effect on our general well-being. During my 2nd half-year of taking letrozole, I experienced worsening pain, tightness on both shoulders and frequent  brown discharge from my vagina. I happened to have a regular check up with a RO and mentioned to her of my discharge. She checked it, which caused me a lot of discomfort, and said it was very red, inflamed down there. She told me to see specialist. I knew my symptoms are caused by letrozole and I have had enough of doctor's appointment.  I don't want to take more    medicine to treat side effects of another    medicine.     So I decided to stop letrozole for a week or two… then I just never go back to it. It has been over two months since stopping letrozole and I feel much better. It's  solely my personal decision. I have told this to my surgeon during a routine check up and he didn't say much. I will tell my oncologist on my next routine check up in two weeks. After I stopped letrozole, I started practicing Falun Gong. I feel more energetic, much calmer and happier.  I have read countless stories of terminally ill people gaining full health after they started practicing Falun Gong.Hope to hear from you regularly.\", 'Hi Beauz.  Great to hear from you too.  I’m so glad you are feeling better.   I have never heard of Falun Gong and will check it out.  Today I went to the gym.

Hormone medicine is definitely no picnic for many of us.I saw my MO this week, and told her about this thumb/hand/wrist/nerve pain I've had the last 2-3 weeks. I suspected that it was because of the Aromasin, but she confirmed it. Apparently it's a known problem that affects some people, and if I continue with this medicine it will only get worse. Aside from being painful, I'll gradually lose hand function. I was advised to stop Aromasin, take a break, and then we'll switch to Letrozole to see if that's any better.

So, I was getting Keytruda every third week from my first infusion all through chemotherapy. That makes it hard to say exactly which side effects came from which drugs, but I do know that chemo is cumulative ... every week my window of \"good days\" got a little bit shorter in between. I did also feel generally worse during the weeks that I was getting the Keytruda, though there were no specific extra symptoms to pinpoint, just a general feeling of ickiness.I finished chemo in early July and have since had 4/9 of my stand alone infusions of Keytruda. I will say that I haven\\'t had any notable symptoms with these infusions, except for some skin redness. I also experienced decreased neutrophils (I think we all do while undergoing chemo) and had increased AST/ALT levels. My AST/ALT levels are still above normal range, but trending down each time I have labs, so my MO is not concerned.

They are actually retesting HER2 status now as the IDC has a lower grade and appears less aggressive. If it isn’t HER2 positive (unlikely), then we will do the Oncotype DX. But as it stands, it looks like the most likely path is chemo starting mid April for 12 weeks, a year of Herceptin, radiation on the lymph node areas and Tamoxifen (I am pre menopausal).', 'Taxol (paclitaxel) and Taxotere (doxetaxl) are indeed both taxanes, but Taxotere is a stronger dosing.  The current prescribing guideline for Taxol as a stand alone chemotherapeutic agent for Her2+ breast cancer is for patients who are stage 1, usually 1cm tumor or smaller, and node negative, to be accompanied by Herceptin, abbreviated TH - and is usually given post-surgically for 12 weeks with Herceptin, then the Herceptin is continued for the balance of the year.  Taxol can be used in a combined regimen with an anthracycline drug - Adriamycin given with Cytoxan for 4 dose dense infusions, then either 4 dose dense Taxol, or 12 weekly Taxol given with Herceptin, and with Perjeta, AC-TH(P), if warranted by your clinical findings - usually 2cm tumor or larger, or node positive. If Perjeta is used then chemo is usually neoadjuvent.  If the suggested regimen is Taxotere, Carboplatin, Herceptin, and possibly Perjeta, TCH(P), for 6 cycles, Taxol is not a suitable substitution. This regimen is usually given neoadjuvently if accompanied by the Perjeta. If Perjeta is not used either of these regimens can be given adjuvently. Here is a  NCCN link to the types of chemo regimens given for Her2+ patients:https://www.nccn.org/patients/guidelines/stage_i_ii_breast/#56One thing you might consider is using cold caps with Taxotere to preserve your hair - cold capping generally works well if you use it with taxane based chemo, rather than anthracycline based. I think the oncologist you spoke with is underestimating the risk of alopecia with Taxotere, while still a rarity it is greater than 1%.', 'Although they are both in the general class of \"taxanes\", the drugs paclitaxel (Taxol) and docetaxel (Taxotere) are two distinct drugs with different chemical structures as illustrated below:The main structure is common to both. However, they differ at two positions:(1) The nature of the substituent \"R1\" (at the very top, center); and(2) The nature of the substituent \"R2\" (located just above the inset box).For the actual substituents at those positions, see the inset box, which identifies what R1 and R2 are in each compound.BarredOwl', 'There is a 2015 article  that examines the difference in efficacy and side effects between Taxotere and Taxol titled \"Balancing activity and tolerability of neoadjuvant paclitaxel- and docetaxel-based chemotherapy for HER2-positive early stage breast cancer: Sensitivity analysis of randomized trials\".  I  don\\'t know if the study is considered good evidence or not.In the end, I chose Taxotere (which followed an anthracycline) over Taxol.  Taxotere carries a greater risk of permanent hair loss, while Taxol puts the patient at risk of neuropathy (neurotoxicity).  I figured that I would rather be permanently bald than in permanent pain.   My mother developed permanent neuropathy from Taxol and she really suffers from it. Here is the abstract (if anyone wants the rest of the article, please PM me):\"Paclitaxel and docetaxel represent the most adopted taxanes in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Questions still remain with regard to their difference in terms of activity and tolerability. Events for pathological complete response (pCR), severe and febrile neutropenia (FN), and severe neurotoxicity were pooled by adopting a fixed- and random-effect model. A sensitivity analysis to test for the interaction between paclitaxel and docetaxel was accomplished. Absolute differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the number of patients needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) were calculated to derive the Likelihood of being Helped or Harmed (LHH). Data from 15 trials (3601 patients) were included. Paclitaxel significantly increases pCR rate by 6.8% in comparison with docetaxel (43.4%, 95% CI 41.1–45.7% versus 36.6%, 95% CI 34.3–39.0%, p = 0.0001), regardless of the chemotherapy backbone, with an absolute difference of 9% and 9.2% for anthracy- cline-based or free-regimens. Paclitaxel significantly improves pCR versus docetaxel with a single HER2-inhibition by 6.7% (p = 0.0012), with no difference if combined with a dual HER2-inhibition. Severe neutropenia and FN are significantly lower with paclitaxel, with an absolute difference of 32.4% (p < 0.0001) and 2.5% (p = 0.0059), respectively. Conversely, severe neurotoxicity is slightly higher with paclitaxel (3%, p = 0.0001). The LHH ratio calculated for pCR and severe neutropenia is 2.0 and 0.7 for pac- litaxel and docetaxel. Although the activity of neoadjuvant paclitaxel and docetaxel HER2-positive breast cancer is considered similar, the slight advantage in pCR, the significantly lower neutropenia and FN, do favor paclitaxel (in the weekly fashion) over docetaxel, despite the slightly worst neurotoxicity.\"', 'So, I think that you, like me, are HER2+. You are receiving the standard of care treatment for stage 1 HER2+ cancer. My tumor is also small at 11mm, but had spread to one lymph node (huge shock at surgery as it wasn’t picked up in MRI, my cancer was originally diagnosed as Stage 0 DCIS and nobody thought there was any IDC or lymph node involvement).So I had a mastectomy first for 9 cm of DCIS and ended up with these surprises at final pathology. My PET scan confirmed no additional node involvement nor did I have lymphatic invasion so I am hopeful it was confined to the one sentinel node. I really wanted the early stage treatment, but had two opinions that urged me to do the stronger stuff so here I am. \\n I did 9 weeks of Paclitaxel with Herceptin and Perjeta and am now doing EC chemo for 3 cycles. I have 2 more left. I am in Europe where this is standard of care. In the US, they use 6 cycles of TCHP more commonly (Taxotere, Carboplatin, Hercepta and Perjeta). I will have radiation of my axilla when I finish chemo. Then I will start hormone blockers and complete my year of Herceptin. Anyways. I found the Paclitaxel very doable and had minimal side effects. My hair thinned a bit (I cold capped) but hung on nicely through that. I think most people have fairly minor side effects and it is very effective for early stage HER2+.'], 'Paclitaxel Albumin-stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation': [], 'Palbociclib': ['Formerly known as gatomal…waiting for a recurrence is like waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I began chemo in November of 2020, and completed 3 cycles of taxol + carboplatin with no issues. I also received pembrolizumab on my 1st and 4th treatments. A few hours after my 4th treatment I developed a fever and was hospitalized for 2 days to rule out infection. During that hospital stay my liver enzymes were elevated. The same thing happened after my 5th treatment as well, but the liver looked much worse so I started a high dose steroid regimen (doctors thought it was hepatitis caused by the pembro). For my 6th treatment we tried carboplatin alone thinking maybe I was reacting to the taxol, but I still developed a fever and heightened liver response, along with dangerously low sodium levels. After that we decided to switch to doxorubicin and cytoxan. I have completed 3 cycles, but it has really done a number on my immune system and my tumor is growing (slowly, but still not good). I just found out the tumor is growing today, so we’ll be deciding how to proceed tomorrow. We have discussed many times going back on carbo-taxol because it was really effective, so I think that’s probably the plan. For as long as I can handle it anyway.I’m not even sure what I’m looking for here, support? Someone who’s been through something similar? Ideas? My tumor was shrinking so quickly at the beginning of all this and now it’s growing and I just don’t know how to handle the possibility that it may not be gone at the time of surgery.

That year at SABCS, Dr. Jones and colleagues reported that, among more than 1,000 women, those who took a Taxotere/Cytoxan combination had a lower rate of relapse than those on the standard treatment. ...The favorable trend toward a non-anthracycline alternative has continued in 2007. This year, Dr. Jones, based at the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, and colleagues reported that seven years after treatment, women who received the non-anthracyline treatment have a better survival rate in general, as well as survival without cancer recurrence, something that has not been found in previous studies. At the end of this analysis, 87 percent of women who took the non-anthracycline regimen were alive, compared with 82 percent of those receiving the standard treatment. ...Meanwhile, further studies described during the [2007 SABCS] meeting are trying to determine which women should remain with anthracyclines, and which could use an alternative. Anthracyclines target a particular enzyme, called topoisomerase, or TOPO II. Therefore, if a tumor isn\\'t drawing on this enzyme for growth, there would be little need for an anthracycline drug. This may be the case for the vast majority of breast cancers, says Dennis Slamon, MD, PhD, of UCLA\\'s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. During the meeting, he described studies that tried to tease out the influence of HER2 status in cancer treatment. They found that in some women the HER2 overexpression works in tandem with TOPO II leaving the tumor extremely vulnerable to the anthracycline drug. However, they did not find any instance of a HER2-negative tumor that also relied on TOPO II. If this analysis holds, Dr. Slamon argues, it would mean that more than 90 percent of breast cancers have no target for anthracycline drugs. He also believes the studies that have found a benefit for anthracyclines have not accounted for whether the benefit is confined to those tumors that are HER2 positive, enlisting TOPO II as an accomplice. ...\"+++++++I\\'ve read some of the original papers to which the \"Cure Today\" article refers.\\xa0 I didn\\'t find them until after my onco had approved TC and I had started chemo.\\xa0 They make me glad I chose that option.otter'], 'Tecentriq (Atezolizumab)': [], 'Tepadina (Thiotepa)': [], 'Thiotepa': [], 'Toremifene': [], 'Trastuzumab': [\"Hi everyone.

I requested that I be given Udenyca, a biosimilar for Neulasta, instead of Zarxio (sim to Nupogen also given in place of Neulasta, because my 2nd opinion specialist from City of Hope told me that he does not recommend Zarxio and prefers Udenyca. (Update: They didn\\'t agree to Udenyca but they did finally agree to another Neulasta long-acting biosimilar.)3. My dietitian recommended several blood tests for me but my MO denied the test for the various B vitamins because they said that it is not related to chemotherapy.

However, trastuzumab treatment is hampered by cardiotoxicity, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline with a reported incidence ranging from 3 to 27% depending on variable factors. Early identification of patients at increased risk of trastuzumab-induced myocardial damage is of great importance to prevent deterioration to irreversible cardiotoxicity. Although current cardiac monitoring with multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning and/or conventional 2D-echocardiography (2DE) have a high availability, their reproducibility are modest, and more sensitive and reliable techniques are needed such as 3D-echocardiography (3DE) and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE). But which other diagnostic imaging modalities are available for patients before and during trastuzumab treatment? In addition, what is the optimal frequency and duration of cardiac monitoring? At last, which biomarker monitoring strategies are currently available for the identification of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with trastuzumab?I plan to switch to a PPO in Nov during open enrollment but will have to live with Kaiser till Jan when the new plan begins.
