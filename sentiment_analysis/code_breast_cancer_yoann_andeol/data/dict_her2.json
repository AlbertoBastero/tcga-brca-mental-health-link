        "May I ask what type of breast cancer your wife has? Judging from what I'm reading, that can make a great difference in the efficacy of anathracycline-based treatments like AC-T, which seem to be most effective against HER2 positive cancer.A significant article on anathracycline cardiotoxicity is avaliable online at http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/125/1/47. As this was published in 1996, presumably adjustments have been made in the dosage of Adriamycin since then. However, if you compare the current recommended dosage to the information in the article, you will discover that bad reactions occurred at less than the current recommended dose. Furthermore, many of the effects did not materialize until years after the treatment, so I don't see how anyone can be sure that the same thing will not continue to occur, though perhaps at a reduced rate. In my experience all oncologists who recommend anthracyclines dismiss the cardiac issue as insignificant. I don't know where the 5% figure comes from.  If this has been demonstrated I have not found the documentation.  If you find it, please let me know. As for the relative merits of TC, AC,and Taxol, see the articles at http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/HER2-anthracycline0108'htttp://www.medpagetoday.com/Hematology/Oncology/BreastCancer/2308  http://www.professional.cancerconsultants.com/print.aspx?id=41014 http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/printerfriendlynews.php?newsid=85301You can find many more by using your browser.

        "It has to do with the overexpression of a gene that only seems to be present in Her2 positive cancers. The study was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium last year. I couldn't find a direct link to the study, but it is the first presentation reported at this summary of the symposium. I, personally, was persuaded not to do AC based on this, but as others have mentioned here, it was a retrospective meta-analysis so many oncologists would not recommend changing treatment based soley on this type of a study.  http://www.nosurrenderbreastcancerhelp.com/2007_SABCS_NEWS.html",
        "Here's an example of the information revkat was talking about:  http://www.curetoday.com/sabcs2007/thurs/feature.phpThat site discusses reports at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium from Dennis Slamon's group at UCLA and also from Stephen Jones at Baylor.  Both oncologists believe anthracyclines (e.g., Adriamycin) are over-used.  Even more important, they have reported clinical trial results that show Adriamycin is probably not necessary, and possibly not even effective, in HER2-negative BC.  Here's some of what is in the article I cited above--\"As far back as 2003, data began to hint that an alternative non-anthracycline regimen, using Taxotere (docetaxel) and Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), might offer as good or better disease-free survival for early-stage breast cancer. That year at SABCS, Dr. Jones and colleagues reported that, among more than 1,000 women, those who took a Taxotere/Cytoxan combination had a lower rate of relapse than those on the standard treatment. ...The favorable trend toward a non-anthracycline alternative has continued in 2007. This year, Dr. Jones, based at the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, and colleagues reported that seven years after treatment, women who received the non-anthracyline treatment have a better survival rate in general, as well as survival without cancer recurrence, something that has not been found in previous studies. At the end of this analysis, 87 percent of women who took the non-anthracycline regimen were alive, compared with 82 percent of those receiving the standard treatment. ...Meanwhile, further studies described during the [2007 SABCS] meeting are trying to determine which women should remain with anthracyclines, and which could use an alternative. Anthracyclines target a particular enzyme, called topoisomerase, or TOPO II. Therefore, if a tumor isn't drawing on this enzyme for growth, there would be little need for an anthracycline drug. This may be the case for the vast majority of breast cancers, says Dennis Slamon, MD, PhD, of UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. During the meeting, he described studies that tried to tease out the influence of HER2 status in cancer treatment. They found that in some women the HER2 overexpression works in tandem with TOPO II leaving the tumor extremely vulnerable to the anthracycline drug. However, they did not find any instance of a HER2-negative tumor that also relied on TOPO II. If this analysis holds, Dr. Slamon argues, it would mean that more than 90 percent of breast cancers have no target for anthracycline drugs. He also believes the studies that have found a benefit for anthracyclines have not accounted for whether the benefit is confined to those tumors that are HER2 positive, enlisting TOPO II as an accomplice. ...\"+++++++I've read some of the original papers to which the \"Cure Today\" article refers.  I didn't find them until after my onco had approved TC and I had started chemo.  They make me glad I chose that option.otter",
        "I can relate to Sylviamorrissmith,   During my 10th treatment of 15 weekly treatment. I started with my nails turning black, because I also have Dermatomyositis my doctor said I was having a flare.Yet after some blood work and other test it turns out no flare. I now need a wheelchair or cane. The pain at night is awful. I wish they would have stop at the 10th treatment of my chemo. I had HER2+on my left breastvery early stage with no lymph nodes involved. I had a mastectomy , but was told I needed the chemo..",
        "Here's a repost of what I originally wrote on the subject with an important update on the subject of progesterone and HER2 status:Progesterone and breast cancer is an interest of mine. I've discovered that it's a complex subject that is not yet very straight forward.Certain progestins had been used in the past to treat breast cancer but I can find little information on it. One of them was medroxyprogesterone acetate, which is ironic because that is the progestin implemented in an increase of breast cancer rates in post menopausal women who took HRT to alleviate symptoms of menopause.Here is one of the few studies I found on the use of medroxyprogesterone in the treatment of breast cancer.Oral medroxyprogesterone acetate in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.As an aside...it seems that not all progestins affect breast cancer risk and breast cancer proliferation equally. Unfortunately many studies do not differentiate between different progestins, but here is a study that sought to distinguish the risk from micronized progesterone (bio identical) from synthetic progestins if you are interested.The impact of micronized progesterone on breast cancer risk: a systematic reviewIt should be noted they are talking about risk of developing breast cancer, and not the actual effect on already existing breast cancer.To continue with using progestins to treat breast cancer...There is renewed interest in treating ER+/PR+ breast cancer with progestins, this time I believe bio identical progesterone and there are three clinical trials planned or already under way. The idea is that in hormone receptor positive breast cancer, the progesterone receptors are attached to the estrogen alpha receptors, and when activated, interfere with the ability of the estrogen alpha receptors to be activated.Progesterone receptor modulates ERα action in breast cancerHere is a nice article on that paper.Solving a breast cancer mystery – why do 'double-positive' women do better?Here is a link to one of the clinical trials involving progesterone therapy in breast cancer. They are not including people with stsge IV in it but those running the trial might have some information or resources that could be of help.A trial looking at progesterone to treat early breast cancer in premenopausal womenWhile progesterone may have an inhibitory effect on ER/PR positive breast cancer, it has been implicated in Herceptin resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer.Progesterone impairs Herceptin effect on breast cancer cellsThe above study found that the progesterone activated the HER2/HER3 signaling pathway (HER2 receptors are activated and cause cell proliferation by the activation of other HER receptors). While the study only briefly mentions it, HER1 which is also called EGFR can also activate HER2. Though the above study does not mention it, one of the things that activates HER1 is a compound called amphiregulin, and one of the things that causes the expression of/interacts with amphiregulin is progesterone.The only thing I have on that right now are a few papers on amphiregulin, progesterone, estrogen, and breast development and a paper that concluded that amphiregulin confers herceptin resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Amphiregulin confers trastuzumab resistance via AKT and ERK activation in HER2-positive breast cancer.I think we will see studies that better investigate the relation between these things in the future but until then it is difficult to say who progesterone will help and who it will hurt.One more thing. One study I found observed a bi phastic effect of progesterone on breast cancer. In some instance they observed cell proliferation and in other inhibition.Biphasic Regulation of Breast Cancer Cell Growth by Progesterone: Role of the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors, p21 and p27KipA general disclaimer for the general public: As always, take these studies with a grain of salt. We aren't mice or petri dishes. Research is a discovery process. Conclusions are tentative and sometimes subjective. Biology is complex. And researchers aren't infallible. And make sure your doctor is aware of and onboard with any treatments, medical or alternative that you embark on.Edit: I just noticed that the website the paper on medroxyprogesterone as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer has links to more papers on the matter. One details it's use in ER+/PR+ breast cancer specifically.",
        "I gather from your chemo regimen you are Her2 positive. I am too, but I did THP as my MO didn't think I needed the carboplatin. She offered it to me if I wanted it. You are at the hump, where finishing feels like an insurmountable task. Once you get on the downhill slope, you will realize that you can make it. I also had 2 different types of breast cancer but both tumors were in my left breast. I chose a double mastectomy (prophylactic for the right side) without reconstruction. I wanted symmetry, and I wanted to reduce my chances of dealing with another cancer developing on the contralateral side. I know it's rare, but my situation is already rare, so I figured it was more likely for me than the usual odds.Her2 Positive is a long treatment plan, but you can do it! Hugs!",
        "hi just had my 2nd cycle of phesgo with docetaxal I’m her2 positive and oestrogen positive - for 4 cycles of phesgo and then 4 of EC then surgery.

        "Hello All,I was originally on Herceptin/Perjeta for HER2 positive cancer, but switched to Kadcyla after lumpectomy revealed some residual disease left.I now have Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED) which is a common manifestation in macular degeneration.  While I am 61, I've never had any issues with my eyes and no one on either side of my family has ever had any form of macular degeneration.I will see a retina specialist later this week, but just very worried about potentially losing my vision and whether it's related to the toxic nature of my treatment.Wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar?My onco has paused the Kadcyla until she gets info from retina specialist.Thank you for this incredible community.",
        "Diagnosed with bilateral IDC 10 days ago. Multiple tumors are located back towards the chest wall. At least one of them is HER2 positive. Double mastectomy is scheduled for 10/27/20. I opted for no reconstruction. I know basically what is involved in the surgery. I know that I'll go home with 2 drains. I also know that everyone has a slightly different experience, but would love to hear from people who have been through the process. Particularly how long it took to be able to move around, take a walk, drive etc. I live alone and am staying with my parents after surgery. I do love my parents and am grateful for their help, but I want to be back in my own home as soon as possible. I'm a bit of a hermit and value my alone time. Just feeling a bit anxious about being around others 24/7 and possibly getting cranky and obnoxious. I don't want to be that way, but I know how I feel whenever I'm stressed and can't get off by myself for a bit to calm down.",
        "Thank you for replying. I was in stage 1b, it was in my lymph nodes, but only one. I had HER2positive. Ihave looked in to the other aromatase inhibitors, but each basically have the same side effects. I’m thinking about tamoxifen, but might try naturally to lower my estrogen. Be well, Mindy Spiridigliozzi",
        "I was hormone negative, Her2 positive, also a very aggressive cancer. With Stage 3, it’s kind of a no-brainer that chemo will be part of the treatment. But even if it was stage 1, I would have opted for chemo. The recurrence/metastases rates are just too high for me to have felt comfortable with no chemo. As everyone says, it’s up to you but ask lots of questions. And although it’s not pleasant, chemo is definitely do-able and it is over before you know it",
        "I had HER2 positive, also considered an aggressive cancer, but luckily a little more treatable than triple negative. I never questioned doing chemo and honestly it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. It w sucked — a lot — no getting around that, but it was not nearly the horrible experience my imagination conjured. Chemo is doable. If it was a less aggressive cancer or chemo was of questionable value the equation would be different , but if the MO recommends chemo then I would do it.Your original question asked: what are the ramifications of skipping chemo, and the answer is that you risk a recurrence or a spread — and once breast cancer goes to stage IV it is considered incurable and you will likely spend the rest of your life getting treated until you run out of treatment options. I know that sounds horrible and terrifying — but that is the cold, hard truth. Breast cancer when caught early is curable for most women — but once it spreads beyond the breast and lymph nodes the equations change dramatically. I would find a strong chemo forum in this community and you and your husband should both read through it to see what other women in similar circumstances experienced. Some women have to quit early or have terrible side effects, but for most of us it’s not nearly as bad as we thought it would be.good lick",
        "I just completed my 4th round of chemo on May 6th.  I am HER2 positive and am receiving Herceptin, Perjeta and Taxotere every 3 weeks.  Nausea has been the absolute worst from the beginning, but I'm now experiencing a real heaviness in my legs which makes it difficult to walk any considerable distance.  I get super tired and have to stop and rest.  I've lost about 16 lbs in chemo, and I am not eating great which makes me weak.  Thank goodness for protein shakes.  Anyone else experiencing this?",
        "bearytriplepositive As soon as I read your original post, I thought, is she on TCHP? Because I had those exact symptoms. There were a few nights after my first round that I thought I was actually going to die from the stomach pain. Also I wondered about getting an ng-tube (feeding tube), but searched the breastcancer.org forums and nobody seems to do that. My oncologist prescribed a PPI -- generic Pantoprazole 20 mg (brand name is Protonix), instead of Prilosec. It helped but not enough. So they upped my dose to 40 mg daily before breakfast. That took care of (most) of the pain and heartburn, so I was able to eat and gain weight back. I also had my steroid cut in half (I now take Dexamethasone 4 mg twice a day, before, day of and day after chemo). I also had my Carboplatin reduced from 6 to 5 AUC (but I am ER-/PR-). I still have the \"lump in the throat/food is slow to go down\" you described (but it is not painful anymore), so I drink water between every small bite. I am scheduled to see a onco-GI doctor on Friday (one day after my final TCHP chemo). The GI effects have been, by far, the worst part of chemo for me. It is miserable. I have spent more than a few dinners crying at the table. I try to force food down when I can, because I feel sicker on an empty stomach, and like you, I don't want to lose more weight. I have seen a few other posts of people suffering with this, and it's always (usually) TCHP. You are not alone!Here are the foods I can usually eat (had to experiment a lot and tried a lot of suggestions from people on this board), I hope it helps with some ideas for you:Greek full-fat yogurt (Fage brand) (sometimes with honey mixed in)Hard boiled eggs: My main protein sourceBaked potato (sometimes with butter and/or yogurt): I agree with the other posters' suggestions to try baked potatoes! OatmealPlain lunchmeat (chicken without nitrates)Chicken noodle soups: Sometimes  tolerable, but I have to change brands frequentlyDried seaweed snacks (Gimme or Annie Chun brand): As you can see from the list, this is my main vegetableFruit: Bananas, and fresh and canned apples and pears.Drinks: Chemo made it difficult to drink plain water. Fizzy water (Polar) is ok, a few drops of lemon juice (or a splash of apple juice) makes tapwater more drinkable. Pedialyte whenever I feel I might be dehydrated.Protein shakes: When I truly can't eat, I try to choke down a Boost (chocolate) or Ensure (vanilla). It helps.Almost forgot: String cheese and cottage cheese.I wish I had useful advice to give you. Based on my experience, the only thing I can think of is:Possibly ask your oncologist whether prescription Protonix/Pantoprazole might work better than Prilosec. And also, whether changing the dose around might be causing problems. I've also seen posts from people who alternate their PPI with Carafate or Pepcid AC (but I haven't tried that).Possibly consult a GI doctor who has plenty of experience with cancer patients. This is an article I found, one of the authors is the doctor I will see on Friday. I don't know if it has anything specifically helpful, but may help you realize that you are not alone, and that GI symptoms can be truly devastating to deal with: https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2015.65.7973Keep trying with different foods/nutrition sources.

I hope your doctor will put some thought into it, and come up with some reasonable ideas to try to help with the heartburn and GI misery. It does feel good to not be alone, but I agree, it's awful to think of someone else having to deal with this!By the way, the GI specialist I saw last week did confirm to me that when people decrease their PPI dose, it can cause \"rebound\" problems, including more heartburn and pain. Fingers crossed it gets better for you, as it did for me. I'd love to know what your dr says, and if you discover any good solutions!PS I also wanted to mention, as another food source, smoothies. Combinations of yogurt, almond milk, soy milk, bananas, frozen berries, Nutella, etc, with a little ice. We bought the cheapest \"Nutribullet\" blender.

        "Hi again bearytriplepositive! Thank you  for your posts! I'm sorry I am so slow to reply, I was in that post-chemo sick phase. I hope things went well for you yesterday. Was this your 4th TCHP?I have the same feeling as you about medication - the less the better. I have no idea why I am so reticent, because like you said, we have to do whatever we can to get through this acute phase. I have a buddy (who I met thru a local BC group) who went thru this last year, and she sort of said the same thing, but I didn't really understand what she meant until the last few weeks. It's good you've had this realization earlier in the process!My GI appt was just ok. It was useful to learn about tapering off the PPI after chemo. But she seemed so aggressive, wants to scope me before surgery. I'll push to have surgery first tho. I can't imagine dealing with the \"prep\" and after effects while on chemo.My next steps are (1) Surgery (probably lumpectomy because the chemo has shrunk my tumors down to nothing) then (2) the standard course of HP or TDM1, depending what they find during surgery. But first, just recover from the final TCHP, ugh.Thanks for posting about your appointment! It sounds like your Dr is taking you seriously, and really trying things, with the lidocaine drink and the IV pepcid? That is great - it means you were able to convey that this is a big deal and not \"just heartburn\"! Fingers crossed this works for you!When do you see the GI? Does it sound like your dr wants you to have an endoscopy/colonoscopy?Also, can I ask what is the soy drink you mentioned?Please post how you're doing, when you can!PS I've just noticed that Ondansetron (Zofran)  mysteriously seems to help my GI issues. It's an anti-nausea pill, but it really seems to help alleviate my \"grinding\" stomach pain, and even some of my lower GI pain/discomfort. I don't take it everyday, just at my worst, and just 1 pill (4 mg). It doesn't make me constipated (a common side effect), but does seem to reduce \"poop frequency\" which is a good thing (haha sorry for TMI!).

Single horizontal line straight across the chest at (former) nipple level, two flat lines at the bottom of the breast, diagonal lines, curved lines, etc. But the photos are not 100% informative. For one thing, it's impossible to deduce how they would look in different lighting conditions, different body positions, etc. I'm feeling very lost for information about this...Scar placement etc is discussed all the time for reconstruction and regular augmentation. But not for flat closures. Is one type of incision is preferable over the others? I'd love to hear anybody's experience with flat closure. What type of incision do you have?

        "I am Her2 positive and iced my hands and feet during chemo to prevent neuropathy. I did get some mild numbness in my toes and 2 fingers, but nothing serious. My understanding is that the cold constricts the blood vessels, thus preventing the chemo from reaching your extremities during the infusion.

        "nipab, Salamander and all.I was told from the gate with my breast surgeon, that because my tumor was 5cm and my breast is not large, a lumpectomy is not a choice if margins are needed. Even after 13 rounds of chemo, my tumor shrunk 1/2. After a decision to remove the breast as chemo became a no option, i was given the best choice they said for me, which was a skin saving expander. Not bigger, just 600 CC of saline are in it. I am at the Cit of Hope and genetics are often offered for their research. I have BRCA-2. I was ES-+/PR-/HER2-, then my tumor gave me a HER2+. I cannot wait for the other breast to get cancer. I will say they are both even in size, the real and fake. But the real sags. Small size or not. For me, I am not going to worry about reoccurrence. I am now on Herceptin and projera? forgot its name, for the next year every 3 weeks. I asked my MO if there is any way to know if it works. She looked right at me and said no. In my case, i would likely be tested regularly. They always rate you based on the tumor size at first. 5 cm...5.2 before chemo started. That and my HER2 positive have altered my journey.",

I told him I was tapped and couldn't pay for that. He said he was in the business of getting people well...and is treating me without payment. I presume they are looking for help. No one has said anything.I can't fill in my diagnoses completely. Large (3+cm) with a large swollen area around it, also in several lymph nodes. The largest node is 1.5 cm. My breast feels like someone put a tennis ball in it.Mother died of this same thing. Estrogen positive, progesterone positive, HER2 positive, I believe. I think all that makes it Stage 3?So, the doctor has a class this week. I'm assuming they'll do a port the next week and start CAT.Any tips on any of this?Thanks for listening.Bev Meade",

        "Hi everyone - I am a week out from lumpectomy (about 2.5 cm plus margins) and SLNB (3 or 4 nodes). My armpit is still a bit swollen. Just sort of generalized mild swollen-ness of the whole underarm area. It's soft, not hard, and not hot or painful (just achy if I stretch or poke at it).Does anyone here remember whether they were swollen after SLNB, and how long it lasted? Also, has anyone developed a seroma after SLNB, and how was it diagnosed?TIA for any info!Sarah_____________Diagnosis: Mixed IDC and ILC (with DCIS and LCIS). Right breast (5 cm). Right axillary lymph nodes (several up to 1 cm).Pathology: ER negative (0%), PR negative (0%), HER2 positive. IHC 3+ (100% of cells). FISH positive (ratio 16.1).

        "Hello all!I am just chiming in as I am the same age (51) with a similar diagnosis. I was diagnosed with DCIS only back in early February based on some calcifications found on my annual mammogram. My MRI showed that it was a large area of DCIS so my doctors recommended a single mastectomy followed by immediate DIEP reconstruction. I had that done on March 13 and am healing well. Unfortunately, pathology turned up an occult IDC tumor that was 1 cm.PLUS, one sentinel node metastasis.  None of this was seen on any of the mammograms, ultrasounds or the MRI so was a shock to all of us. Anyways. My DCIS was HER2 positive so based on that assumption that the tumor is the same biology, I think I will be offered weekly Paclitaxel plus Herceptin. They are actually retesting HER2 status now as the IDC has a lower grade and appears less aggressive. If it isn’t HER2 positive (unlikely), then we will do the Oncotype DX. But as it stands, it looks like the most likely path is chemo starting mid April for 12 weeks, a year of Herceptin, radiation on the lymph node areas and Tamoxifen (I am pre menopausal).",
        "Hello ladies! I’m over the moon to have found this forum to share with actual ladies on similar journeys. I was was diagnosed through a routine mammogram in June of 2023, completed a biopsy and then lumpectomy in August of 2023 with 2 resections to follow as the cancer kept evading my medical team. It was the determined by 3 oncology surgeons recommendations that due to the location and final diagnosis (Stage 1, Grade 3, invasive ductal carcinoma contained regional, node negative but HER2 positive high grade) a unilateral, nipple sparing mastectomy was the best route. I had that done on December 19, 2023 and my oncology surgeon and plastic surgeon were able to do full silicon implant reconstruction at the time of mastectomy. I was released to start my regiment of Taxol and Herceptin once a week for 12 weeks and then continue the Herceptin every three week for an entire year 1/30/24. I had my port put in at my final lumpectomy back in September. I started my TH treatment on 1/30/2024 and finished treatment #3 on 2/13/24.I’m tracking my side effects on my log but don’t have a real pattern yet. My first treatment I felt nothing but a little fatigue. My second treatment I had an allergic reaction, broke out in hives and they gave me an additional Benadryl dose in my port and that sent me into a 5 hour deep sleep drool on yourself nap. When I woke I had some aches on day 3 and 4 and red pimples with white heads all over my chest, neck and head: they went away on day 6. After getting treatment 3 today, I just am wide wake and haven’t slept all night. We will see what the next couple of days hold. \r\nAny advice you all can give on what is to come, products you used for skin care and moisturizing, when you lost your hair if you did, wig vs. no wig, I am the first of my close friend group to experience breast cancer and while I have a close group of 30 women that I love and love me, along with an amazing husband of 29 years and three wonderfully supportive children I need some women that have been in the trenches to lean on. I love my medical team and they are great resources but not battling cancer in our shoes💕\r\nthank you all in advance for being so brave in sharing your stories and experiences and inspirations to those of us just getting started in this marathon of cancer survivorship!",
        "April, my surgeon told us the SNB can tell them a lot about the cancer and what stage it is. My cancer is stage 2a , clear lymph nodes. But because it is HER2 positive 3+ over 2 cm I have to have chemo. The goal is tor the chemo to shrink the mass or the mass disappears. That means the less he will have to remove and that makes him happy. I have a hard time with if there is no lymph nodes with cancer why can' t they just take the breast off. Then the surgeon and MO tell me I may have tiny cancer cells floating around my body so I have to have chemo. Sometimes it sounds like they contradict themselves. I know I have to trust them but it's not so easy to do when I am so scarred. The MO said said if the breast is removed without chemo I would have a 70% chance of the cancer not returning. If I do chemo I have a 85% chance of cancer not returning. I know there are no guarantees with cancer ...",
        "I just found out I was misdiagnosed at the biopsy stage. The test results from the biopsy showed triple positive, with a HER2 of +3, and my oncologist started me right in on neoadjuvant chemo of Herceptin, Perjeta and Taxotere, which I finished and then had a mastectomy of my left breast. My surgeon also removed all of my lymph nodes on the left side of my arm. During surgery, however, the analysis of the cancer that had gone into one of my lymph nodes tested HER2 negative. The original biopsy test was performed at a diagnostic center close to my home, but I was sent to another hospital in a larger city. This hospital has an excellent reputation and I felt very comfortable in their care. When I was told about the discrepancy, I asked my oncologist to re-test the original biopsy (the term for that material is \"blocks\") and he said he would, but was not super excited about it. My breast surgeon, however, was on it immediately and also sent all samples to an independent lab for confirmation. The results showed that the original biopsy was incorrectly diagnosed. They mistakenly found the IHC test to be +3 (on the most positive side of the scale) so they skipped the FISH test. If they had done the FISH test, they would have questioned the IHC test. Unfortunately, no one along the line questioned the HER2 +3 diagnosis without a FISH test and I had an unnecessary round of chemo. I am now looking at a new round of 2 months of bi-weekly chemo for the correct diagnosis, followed by 5 weeks of radiation, 5 days per week. Given my correct diagnosis, I should have had surgery first and then chemo, followed by the radiation. Moral of the story: Get a second opinion of the biopsy to confirm breast cancer sub-type. I would never have imagined this possibility when first diagnosed, as the concept of breast cancer was so daunting. I hope this helps someone.",

        "Hi ruby216,Everyone has explained this really well already. Just writing to say, I'm right there with you--triple positive asking this same question 3 months ago. I tried to bargain with my surgeon, if I had surgery first, was there the possibility I wouldn't need chemo? He wouldn't budge and I was frustrated for a while that he and my MO were overreacting to a very small tumor. Over time, I'm become extremely grateful. Her2 pos is aggressive and it needs to get hit hard so it doesn't come back. My surgery will be after my chemo. I'm now halfway through my 6 dose TCHP and as has been said, it's hard but not as bad as I imagined. Best wishes for your surgery. So sorry you're having to go through this."

        "May I ask what type of breast cancer your wife has? Judging from what I'm reading, that can make a great difference in the efficacy of anathracycline-based treatments like AC-T, which seem to be most effective against HER2 positive cancer.A significant article on anathracycline cardiotoxicity is avaliable online at http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/125/1/47. As this was published in 1996, presumably adjustments have been made in the dosage of Adriamycin since then. However, if you compare the current recommended dosage to the information in the article, you will discover that bad reactions occurred at less than the current recommended dose. Furthermore, many of the effects did not materialize until years after the treatment, so I don't see how anyone can be sure that the same thing will not continue to occur, though perhaps at a reduced rate. In my experience all oncologists who recommend anthracyclines dismiss the cardiac issue as insignificant. I don't know where the 5% figure comes from.  If this has been demonstrated I have not found the documentation.  If you find it, please let me know. As for the relative merits of TC, AC,and Taxol, see the articles at http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/HER2-anthracycline0108'htttp://www.medpagetoday.com/Hematology/Oncology/BreastCancer/2308  http://www.professional.cancerconsultants.com/print.aspx?id=41014 http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/printerfriendlynews.php?newsid=85301You can find many more by using your browser.

        "I can see Caroline's point, but who wants a heart problem at any age? And older women are more vulnerable to this side effect. Even it it's a small risk percentage wise, it's a nasty one. And since we're both HER2 negative, Andriomycin probably wouldn't help us either.",
        "Like I said, I made the decision from reading studies.But then I came on here and found Her2 neg. women who were given AC as neoadjuvant treatment and their tumors shrank to nothing! So what does that mean? It sure seems like that is a sign of effectiveness! On the other hand, what does it mean for chemo to be effective in early stange breast cancer? Is 10 year disease free survival the only legitimate measure, or does what we see happening in our breasts count too? We are trying to kill cells that may be lurking around our bodies but there's no way of knowing if they are there or if we go them all. The whole chemo decision thing made me nuts.Bottom line though, I think either AC or TC will do the job for early stage. (Since I secretly believe that for ER+ Her2neg the real benefit of chemo is that it shuts down your ovaries not that it kills loose cells. Which could be done in less nasty ways, like they often do in Europe -- surgery, radiation, lupron shots. This is only my personal belief based on my non-scientific reading of some studies, so I may be missing something, and probably am missing some really important scientific information.)",
        "Here's an example of the information revkat was talking about:  http://www.curetoday.com/sabcs2007/thurs/feature.phpThat site discusses reports at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium from Dennis Slamon's group at UCLA and also from Stephen Jones at Baylor.  Both oncologists believe anthracyclines (e.g., Adriamycin) are over-used.  Even more important, they have reported clinical trial results that show Adriamycin is probably not necessary, and possibly not even effective, in HER2-negative BC.  Here's some of what is in the article I cited above--\"As far back as 2003, data began to hint that an alternative non-anthracycline regimen, using Taxotere (docetaxel) and Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), might offer as good or better disease-free survival for early-stage breast cancer. That year at SABCS, Dr. Jones and colleagues reported that, among more than 1,000 women, those who took a Taxotere/Cytoxan combination had a lower rate of relapse than those on the standard treatment. ...The favorable trend toward a non-anthracycline alternative has continued in 2007. This year, Dr. Jones, based at the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, and colleagues reported that seven years after treatment, women who received the non-anthracyline treatment have a better survival rate in general, as well as survival without cancer recurrence, something that has not been found in previous studies. At the end of this analysis, 87 percent of women who took the non-anthracycline regimen were alive, compared with 82 percent of those receiving the standard treatment. ...Meanwhile, further studies described during the [2007 SABCS] meeting are trying to determine which women should remain with anthracyclines, and which could use an alternative. Anthracyclines target a particular enzyme, called topoisomerase, or TOPO II. Therefore, if a tumor isn't drawing on this enzyme for growth, there would be little need for an anthracycline drug. This may be the case for the vast majority of breast cancers, says Dennis Slamon, MD, PhD, of UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. During the meeting, he described studies that tried to tease out the influence of HER2 status in cancer treatment. They found that in some women the HER2 overexpression works in tandem with TOPO II leaving the tumor extremely vulnerable to the anthracycline drug. However, they did not find any instance of a HER2-negative tumor that also relied on TOPO II. If this analysis holds, Dr. Slamon argues, it would mean that more than 90 percent of breast cancers have no target for anthracycline drugs. He also believes the studies that have found a benefit for anthracyclines have not accounted for whether the benefit is confined to those tumors that are HER2 positive, enlisting TOPO II as an accomplice. ...\"+++++++I've read some of the original papers to which the \"Cure Today\" article refers.  I didn't find them until after my onco had approved TC and I had started chemo.  They make me glad I chose that option.otter",

        "Here's a repost of what I originally wrote on the subject with an important update on the subject of progesterone and HER2 status:Progesterone and breast cancer is an interest of mine. I've discovered that it's a complex subject that is not yet very straight forward.Certain progestins had been used in the past to treat breast cancer but I can find little information on it. One of them was medroxyprogesterone acetate, which is ironic because that is the progestin implemented in an increase of breast cancer rates in post menopausal women who took HRT to alleviate symptoms of menopause.Here is one of the few studies I found on the use of medroxyprogesterone in the treatment of breast cancer.Oral medroxyprogesterone acetate in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.As an aside...it seems that not all progestins affect breast cancer risk and breast cancer proliferation equally. Unfortunately many studies do not differentiate between different progestins, but here is a study that sought to distinguish the risk from micronized progesterone (bio identical) from synthetic progestins if you are interested.The impact of micronized progesterone on breast cancer risk: a systematic reviewIt should be noted they are talking about risk of developing breast cancer, and not the actual effect on already existing breast cancer.To continue with using progestins to treat breast cancer...There is renewed interest in treating ER+/PR+ breast cancer with progestins, this time I believe bio identical progesterone and there are three clinical trials planned or already under way. The idea is that in hormone receptor positive breast cancer, the progesterone receptors are attached to the estrogen alpha receptors, and when activated, interfere with the ability of the estrogen alpha receptors to be activated.Progesterone receptor modulates ERα action in breast cancerHere is a nice article on that paper.Solving a breast cancer mystery – why do 'double-positive' women do better?Here is a link to one of the clinical trials involving progesterone therapy in breast cancer. They are not including people with stsge IV in it but those running the trial might have some information or resources that could be of help.A trial looking at progesterone to treat early breast cancer in premenopausal womenWhile progesterone may have an inhibitory effect on ER/PR positive breast cancer, it has been implicated in Herceptin resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer.Progesterone impairs Herceptin effect on breast cancer cellsThe above study found that the progesterone activated the HER2/HER3 signaling pathway (HER2 receptors are activated and cause cell proliferation by the activation of other HER receptors). While the study only briefly mentions it, HER1 which is also called EGFR can also activate HER2. Though the above study does not mention it, one of the things that activates HER1 is a compound called amphiregulin, and one of the things that causes the expression of/interacts with amphiregulin is progesterone.The only thing I have on that right now are a few papers on amphiregulin, progesterone, estrogen, and breast development and a paper that concluded that amphiregulin confers herceptin resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Amphiregulin confers trastuzumab resistance via AKT and ERK activation in HER2-positive breast cancer.I think we will see studies that better investigate the relation between these things in the future but until then it is difficult to say who progesterone will help and who it will hurt.One more thing. One study I found observed a bi phastic effect of progesterone on breast cancer. In some instance they observed cell proliferation and in other inhibition.Biphasic Regulation of Breast Cancer Cell Growth by Progesterone: Role of the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors, p21 and p27KipA general disclaimer for the general public: As always, take these studies with a grain of salt.

And make sure your doctor is aware of and onboard with any treatments, medical or alternative that you embark on.Edit: I just noticed that the website the paper on medroxyprogesterone as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer has links to more papers on the matter.

Overall survival is how long people live whether or not the cancer grows or comes back.The findings are the latest results from the INAVO120 trial.Adding inavolisib also improved the number of cancers that shrank by more than 30% in response to treatment, called the objective response rate, or ORR. The ORR was about 63% for cancers treated with the inavolisib combination, compared to 28% for cancers treated with only Ibrance and Faslodex.Nicholas Turner, MD, PhD, FMedSci, of London’s Royal Marsden Hospital, presented the research at a media briefing before the annual meeting and said that the findings “support an inavolisib-based regimen as an emerging new standard of care that helps people live longer, as well as substantially improv[es] how long treatment works.”",

        "Hi, I am scheduled on 12/6 for my lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy. I'm supposed to get an envizio locator(?) on 11/25 which helps the surgeon locate the tissue he needs to remove. I am told my tumor is small (1cm) and that including the margin it may be around 2cm of tissue he will remove. Also I'm thankful to have what my doctors say are favorable features (hormone positive, her2 negative, grade 2). The MRI showed something in the lymph nodes but the doctors say it is most likely negative but they will confirm it with the sentinel node biopsy. I go between scared, anxious, and then completely fine and optimistic in one day. Can anyone share their experience on whether it is normal to swing emotionally and mentally from dread to not worried at all in one day? Also, does anyone with stage 1 ever feel like 'is this even real cancer' and am I or others making a big deal about it but it's not because it's 'just stage 1'? In the beginning, I even wondered if this is real because I feel normal? I even considered whether I even needed to get it treated because it is just stage 1? It did dawn on me a week last week that I do need to go ahead with the surgery and treatment as metastasis is a real risk (right?). I also have reactions from friends that leave me feeling like they think I should not even refer to it as cancer with comments like 'oh it's very treatable' and 'oh you'll be fine'? Thank you in advance for sharing your experience.",

Very ugly and uncomfortable  -  I feel like Frankenstein's bride - but hey, I am grateful no chemo or radiation needed so strategizing next steps. Diagnosis: invasive ductal carcinoma in right breast, 1 cm tumor, ER and PR positive and HER2 negative. No cancer in lymph nodes and low oncotype dx score of 10 with no genetic genes according to tests and in perimenopause. Sleepless nights, mood swings and irritability already and I am not even in menopause so dreading the big drugs they want to put me on - tamoxifen and lupron to suppress ovaries. Decided to pause on drugs for a few months while I get the surgery over with because I have 3% risk of recurrence.Considering a DIEP flap and would love to hear from others if they recommend it or not. If you live in Atlanta Ga and have a fantastic oncologist or Plastic Surgeon, please do share names with me as I do want to get a second opinion! Did anyone has a mastopexy in one breast and a DIEP flap in the other one and if so, any regrets or advice to me before I start down that path? I fear I will look like a patchwork doll after all this....had a nipple sparing mastectomy on right breast so scar going sideways from nipple to side of breast on right breast. Anyone had a DIEP reconstruction on one breast only and did not mess with the other breast at all? Or is it impossible to have symmetry without messing with both boobs?

Tse, MB, BS1; et al8-10 minutes   November 5, 2021The Association of ERBB2-Low Expression With the Efficacy of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibitor in Hormone Receptor–Positive, ERBB2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer JAMA Netw Open.  2021;4(11):e2133132. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.33132  Among the major breakthroughs in the treatment of hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR+/ERBB2− [formerly HER2−]) metastatic breast cancer (MBC), the introduction of 3 cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors into the treatment arsenal has been associated with significant gains in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of patients in first-line and second-line settings.1 However, phenotypic and genetic analysis has yet to identify robust predictive markers associated with the efficacy of these treatments. A potential marker candidate could be associated with the newly proposed subgroup with the nomenclature of ERBB2-low (formerly HER2-low), defined as tumors with an ERBB2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 1+ or 2+ with negative in situ hybridization assay. Approximately 50% of all breast cancers fall under such definition. Studies have suggested bidirectional crosstalk between ERBB2 and HR pathways as a potential mechanism of hormonal resistance and poor outcomes.2 However, an association between ERBB2-low status and treatment outcomes of CDK4/6 inhibitors among patients with MBC was not established. We investigated the association between low levels of ERBB2 expression and clinical outcomes among patients with HR+/ERBB2− MBC treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors.This cohort study was approved by the Kowloon Central/Kowloon East Research Ethics Committee, Hospital Authority, Hong Kong, which approved a waiver of informed consent because the data were deidentified. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.We identified consecutive patients with HR+/ERBB2− MBC who received CDK4/6 inhibitors with letrozole or fulvestrant from March 2017 to June 2020 from a single institutional cancer registry in Hong Kong. ERBB2-low expression was defined as an IHC score of 1+ or 2+ with a negative in situ hybridization. PFS was defined as the time from the initiation of CDK4/6 inhibitor to the date of radiological or clinical progression or death. The association between ERBB2 expression levels and PFS was evaluated using log-rank test and multivariable Cox regression modeling. Covariates included the line of treatment, progesterone receptor status, and disease extent. An α level of 2-sided P ≤ .05 denoted statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software version 23.0 (IBM). Data were analyzed from July 2020 through January 2021.There were 106 women with MBC eligible for analysis. The median (range) age at treatment was 58.0 (23.0-91.4) years. Most patients received palbociclib (90 patients [84.9%]), while the rest received ribociclib (16 patients [15.1%]). CDK4/6 inhibitor was used as the first-line treatment in 54 patients (50.9%). Most patients had tumors that were of ductal histology (88 patients [83.0%]), had a high estrogen receptor H score (ie, H ≥ 200; 76 patients [71.7%]), and had progesterone receptor positive status (81 patients [76.4%]). There were 24 patients [22.6%] with bone-only disease (Table).There were 82 patients (77.3%) considered ERBB2-low expressing, which was associated with a shorter median PFS compared with 24 patients with ERBB2 IHC score of 0 (8.9 months; 95% CI, 6.49-11.30 months vs 18.8 months; 95% CI, 9.44-28.16 months; P = .01) (Figure). In multivariable analysis, ERBB2-low expression remained associated with an inferior PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.03-3.75; P = .04) after adjusting for line of treatment (HR for first line vs beyond first line, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.18-0.53; P < .001), progesterone receptor status (HR for positive vs negative, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.62-3.50; P = .38), and disease extent (HR for bone-only disease vs extraosseous disease, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26-0.97; P = .04).Among patients with HR+/ERBB2− MBC treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, we observed that ERBB2-low expression was associated with an inferior PFS. This may serve as a potential marker candidate associated with CDK4/6 inhibitor efficacy. An intrinsic subtypes genomic analysis of the MONALEESA studies3 found that, overall, the ERBB2-enriched (formerly HER2-enriched) subtype was associated with 2.3-fold increased risk of disease progression compared with the luminal A subtype. Our results provide phenotypical evidence suggesting the inferior efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the ERBB2-low expression subgroup. Some limitations of this study include its retrospective nature with limited sample size, the lack of patients receiving abemaciclib, and the lack of data on PIK3CA mutation status. Given that novel anti-ERBB2 antibody-drug conjugates, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, demonstrated clinical efficacy in ERBB2-low–expressing MBC,4 coupled with emerging evidence supporting the combination use of CDK4/6 inhibitors with anti-ERBB2 agents,5 this subgroup may be of high clinical relevance and warrant prospective evaluations in future trials.",

        "I have nothing to offer beyond I felt the same way at my nationally ranked hospital, too. I will say they did get my imaging results though before I was seen by my oncologist but it wasn't without difficulty and my intervening. They also didn't seem to be nearly as much in a hurry as I thought they should be. It took me 40 days to get my surgery and 13 days of that was because I tested positive on a covid test but despite being asymptomatic they cancelled my surgery. That about sent me over the roof. Anyway they did get it done, the cancer had not traveled to my lymph nodes despite my fear that the delay would cause just that, nor did I even have any LVI. So although I was in a hurry and they didn't appear to be, it seemed they were probably the ones who were correct in my case. For us, our cancer takes top priority but at these hospitals our cancer is one of many they see everyday and the biopsy tells them quite a bit whether a cancer should be seen as advance or quick growing. I was estrogen and progesterone positive and HER2 negative and although not the highest hormonally out there, pretty strongly so. Those cancers you have some time with. So in saying that, I don't know what your biopsy was but if you're hormonally positive know that the chances of it spreading with any small delays is miniscule. Breast cancer just doesn't work that way. Not to say that they don't need to fix their crap and get your imagining. When I had issues with my hospital getting my results sure I had to call, too, but I felt they were doing everything in their power also. That meant a lot. It ended up being my crappy radiologist's fault for the delay and not the hospitals but the stress of it was so needless. In saying that, I feel your pain and I hope it's resolved quickly so you can just move forward with everything.",

        "Hello - I am a 77 year old, post-menopausal woman and am new here. I was recently diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. I've had multiple tests, including CT scans, MRI's, ultrasounds, biopsies, and an Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence test. I had a lumpectomy about a month ago. They removed a 23mm tumor from the right inner quadrant of my right breast. I had not been getting regular mammograms and the tumor was discovered when I broke some ribs.According to the pathology reports, it was grade 1, all margins negative for invasive carcinoma, with no lymph node involvement. It was HR positive, HER 2 negative, with a K-67 score of 6%, which I believe is considered negative. My Oncotype DX recurrence score was 9, with a distance recurrence score of 3% and a group average absolute chemo benefit score of < 1%. I am scheduled to begin radiation treatments next week (15 treatments over 3 weeks).Given my test results, my age, and the side effects, I am inclined to take a pass on hormone treatments. I found the \"Predict\" Breast Cancer tool on this website. It is from Cambridge University in the UK, so I assume it is as reliable as any prediction tool can be. When I entered my results, it basically indicated no benefit to hormone therapy. The 5 and 10 year survival rates with or without hormone treatments for someone my age and condition were basically identical.I visited a medical oncologist last week and he was fairly insistent on hormone treatment. When I mentioned the side effects he said I should give it a try and he could switch meds if I had a bad reaction. He said if I lived this long with few if any medical issues I would probably live at least another 10 years. Honestly, at my age I'm more concerned with quality of life than longevity. I almost got the impression he was pushing hormone treatments (defensive medicine). Maybe I'm being unfair.In addition to quality-of-life side effects like joint pain, hot flashes, etc., I understand that these drugs cause bone loss and death from injuries sustained from falls is one of the leading causes of death among seniors.I would appreciate hearing from people in a similar situation and getting their opinions. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",
        "@lillyishere I did have symptoms—a pain in my upper sternum that would radiate to the right side of upper chest. It was very tender to the touch. This started in January of 2024. I attributed it to my chronic cough and possible costochondritis. It lasted about 10 days, then was gone. In February it happened again for about 7 days. I thought, \"I have got to get this cough under control!\" Then it happened again in March, and April, and May, lasting about a week each time. Mind you, I still had this very intense cough (which was in no way related to my BC, since the cough started 3 years prior after a \"super cold\"). In May I went to see my PCP about something else and mentioned this random pain in my upper chest. He ordered a Chest CT. I truly thought it would show costochondritis; it did not! It came back \"highly suspicious for metastatic breast cancer.\" I was totally shocked, as was my doctor. Then the many tests started. It took several weeks to decide if they should biopsy the soft tissue behind the sternum (which showed uptake on PET) or the top of the sternum (which showed more uptake on PET). It was finally decided to biopsy the sternum. The results were ER+ and PR+, like my first diagnosis, but HER2+ this time. Sixteen years ago I was HER2 negative. You can see a brief history of my journey and treatments in my signature. Currently awaiting ECHO,  Brain MRI, Signatera test, and PET/CT all in mid-July. Soon! Argh!  @kitty75 I hope your experience with exemestane is better than the tamoxifen. I must admit that the anastrozole is starting to give me aches in my muscles and joints. At least, I hope that is the cause and nothing more nefarious. It's also only been 9 weeks since finishing my Rads, which can cause fatigue and other issues. Wishing everyone a smooth journey!Hugs, Pam 💗",

        "Hello. I also posted this on the Treating estrogen responsive cancer naturally board. Not sure about protocol. Part of my quest for a natural estrogen blocker pertains to Miatake and Reishi mushrooms. Here's my story.  I was diagnosed with ILC in February of this year.I had a lumpectomy and lymph node biopsy on March 17. I am ER/PR+, HER2 negative, Grade 1 Tumor (estimated size 1.8 CM), Ki-67 proliferation rate 1%, 1 node with a metastatic focus of slightly > 2mm. My lumpectomy didn't come back with clean margins. I had a contrasting MRI on April 10 and it showed no further sign of ILC, but because the pathology report shows not clean margins I am going in for a second lumpectomy on May 11. My CBC and CMP blood panels all came back excellent. No genetic markers for cancer. Waiting for my Oncotype test results.I have chosen not to do the Tamoxifin because I have Crohn's, which I finally have under control. My doctor really want's me to try it and see if it agrees with me. Knowing my body the way I do I just know it will flare up my Crohn's. So I'm seeking out alternative estrogen blockers that women in my situation have had good results with.Here's what I'm doing:I'm making a shake once a day with the following:1 scoop Garden of Life RAW Organic Perfect Food® Green Super Food2 caps Garden of Life Vitamin Code® Women Raw Whole Food Multivitamin2 caps Garden of Life Vitamin Code® RAW B-Complex™1 cap Garden of Life Vitamin Code® RAW D3 -- 5000 IU1 tbs Ground Flax SeedNOTE: You can empty all Garden of Life Vitamins in to your smoothie and drink them vs. having to swallow a whole bunch of vitamins.3 tsp of the following:1pt Maitake Mushroom Powder to 2 pt Reishi Mushroom, powder (Ling Zhi)In addition to the shake I'm taking:20:1 CBD Tincture (cannabis not hemp) - 7 drops, 3x dailyReishi Extract - 7 drops, 3x daily2 softgels Terry Naturally CuraMed + OPC (French grape seed extract)I keep seeing good things about DIM and AHCC and am wondering if it's a better alternative than what I'm doing. Any thoughts or insights anyone can share will be greatly appreciated. I really want to do all I can to beat this.",
        "Hi Everyone!!So glad I found this site. It's very helpful so you don't feel totally alone while going through this difficult time in our lives and wanted to share my story also.I was diagnosed end of March 2021 with Stage 2 that went into my lymph nodes and very aggressive type. They started me on the ACT regimen right away. I moved as fast as I could to get this going and taken care of ASAP as I was very nervous. The AC was pretty brutal and I got it every other week for 8 treatments. I would get treatment on Monday and sent home with the Neulasta OnPro for the next night to release, once that happened I would start to get more tired and weaker. By Thursday I was pretty wiped and Friday to Sunday I was in bed. Next week no treatment i would come alive again thank god. I got alot of Neuropathy in my feet and fingertips so they had to adjust my dosage down twice because it was also causing pain when I opened and closed my fingers. Also getting out of my car it was like I was 90 years old and took several steps before I would stand up straight then get momentum. I worked the entire time and did get some moments of brain fog for sure but it didn't stay steady. off and on. I then went to Taxol and that did not make me have to lay down for 3 days after and i powered through it.Once surgery they retested my tumors and after being HER2 negative twice from the biopsies, the tumors now tested HER2 postive and now getting treated with Navilbene (chemo) just finished and Herceptin/Perjeta. After my third treatment with this Im noticing my eye twitching and still have alot of the Neuropathy in my feet and some in my fingertips. Along with some muscle cramps in my feet and sometimes calves. Does anyone else get the muscle cramps? I will be getting Hereptin/Perjeta for a full year every 3 weeks to block for any recurrance in the future.",
        "My wife was diagnosed with Stage 2A  ER/PR positive, Her2 Negative back in June 2019. She went  through 2 surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapy. She started taking Tamoxifen in late 2019 or early 2020. She has co-morbodities Thyroid Cancer, Type 2 diabetes, liver steatosis, diabetic nephropathy, and likely depression.  Last month, she told me  she had her first period  since starting Tamoxifen. Anyone know what could be going on here? She will see her oncologist this week. We are quite concerned.",
        "Not sure why the doctor agreed with not checking at least the sentinel node. I had a lumpectomy four years ago for a similar-sized invasive tumor, no DCIS, also highly ER & PR positive, Her2 negative, and they automatically removed the sentinel node - and to the surgeon's and oncologist's surprise, I had a micromet. The original radiation plan was 22 whole breast sessions, which is the pretty basic one. That got changed to 33 sessions of whole breast, axilla, and clavicle, with the last 5 sessions being boosts to the tumor area. If you are in the U.S., the information on the Oncotype is your mother's and has to be made available to her. But going by some of your terminology, I guess you live in another country, and I don't know what laws you have.I was 68 when I had surgery, and I'm 72 now. I make my own medical decisions, not my family. They can give an opinion, IF I ask for one. If your mother is incapacitated in some way that affects her mental capacity or reasoning, then of course you would help her decide.Not knowing if she had any micromets makes the decision tough, but personally (and knowing what mine was gives me a bias), I'd be cautious and go for the wider-ranging radiation.Oh, if you're worried about her age - my mother underwent surgery and the same course of radiation I had when she was 88, and she drove herself to all her sessions in a different town. Her only reaction was getting a bit tired by the end of the full course of sessions, and a tan breast. Same with me, except mine was light pink. Good luck to your mother.",
        "Hi all,I've been experiencing a slow but steady increase in Staging since April 19. Started out as small, easily treated etc., but since then tests, surgery, waiting and more tests, each coming back with worse and worse news (many of you are probably familiar with this story). Tomorrow is the end of the road and I go for scans to look for distant spread. If I'd known then what I know now I'd have borrowed or stolen any amount of money to have those scans done out of pocket right at the start. I'd have either saved a lot of time, or at least eased those worries somewhat. Anyway, I have a telehealth apt with oncologist on Thursday to go over the results.Given that every test has come back with worse results than the one before I'm pretty sure I know the outcome.So can anyone say something encouraging/hopeful for me to keep repeating to myself between now and Thursday morning? And after, come to that? Anything at all???My oncologist has so far been useless in that department. I'm looking for a new one. Maybe she'll rise to the challenge, but in the meantime I'd love to just have someone say don't throw in the towel yet even if this comes to the very worst. There is hope because….I suppose I should post this on the other forum, but I don't know for sure I'm there yet and I'd really like something to hold on to until Thursday.No bad news stories please, although my experience here has been that no one would ever do that.hugs to everyone.S.****IDC 2005 - pre-adjuvant chemo, axillary dissection, post-chemo surgery pathology NED, DXT.April 19 this year - ILC contralateral breast.

        "Sortilin-related receptor is a druggable therapeutic target in breast cancer“....Identifying alternative HER2-related therapeutic targets could offer means to overcome .... resistance mechanisms. We have previously demonstrated that an endosomal sorting protein, sortilin-related receptor (SorLA), regulates the traffic and signaling of HER2 and HER3, thus promoting resistance to HER2-targeted therapy in breast cancer. This study aims to assess the feasibility of targeting SorLA using a monoclonal antibody. Our results demonstrate that anti-SorLA antibody (SorLA ab) alters the resistance of breast cancer cells to HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in vitro and in ovo.““SorLA is a druggable target in breast cancer.“https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.434556v1",

        "I checked the Quackwatch and ScienceBasedMedicine sites; the former is silent about CTC testing, but the latter is skeptical about their utility, as well as about “liquid biopsies” for the reasons Italychick cites. There is no definitive way to interpret the results and not yet any statistical correlation between results and their impact on course of disease or treatment, nor even between cells in blood and cells harvested from the tumor (much less double-blind studies). OTOH, it recognizes the validity and utility of OncotypeDX--perhaps in the near future there will be an analogous genomic assay for estrogen-negative or HER2-positive tumors that can predict their susceptibility to specific cytotoxic and targeted biological therapies beyond what we currently know. But blood and tumor samples are probably as alike as apples and chainsaws.",

I told them that I wanted my vitamin B levels checked because they discovered that my vit D and iron levels are low and I provided them with the following info that I had found:In 'Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy' by Dr Tzatha (Associate Professor of Neurology), she mentions under preventing CIPN to \"optimize/correct co-existing risk factors for neuropathy prior to initiating neurotoxic chemotherapy (HbA1C, B12/B1 deficiency, B6 intoxication, thyroid abnormalities).\" (Excerpt below)Importance of CIPNFor some patients, the side effects and deficits caused by CIPN are so severe that they impair daily function and diminish quality of lifeCIPN can result in chemotherapy dose reductions or early treatment discontinuation, compromising effective cancer treatment and patient survivalProfession-specific disability: especially important for patients who are engaged in professions or activities requiring intact sensory and motor functions, as well as fine control of the hands (e.g., dentist, pianist/professional musician, carpenter, jewelry maker) or feet (e.g., professional driver)PrevalenceIn a recent meta-analysis of 31 studies of CIPN involving a total of 4,179 patients, the aggregate prevalence of CIPN was 48 percentWithin the first month after the patients completed chemotherapy, 68 percent had CIPN; the prevalence decreased to 30 percent after 6 monthsSeretny M, Currie GL, Sena ES, et al Incidence, prevalence, and predictors of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis Pain 2014;155:2461-70Prevalence assessments of CIPN must take into account:chemotherapy regimen administeredduration of patient exposure to the neurotoxic agent(s)evaluation methods usedPreventing CIPNNo high-quality studies demonstrate effective prevention of CIPN using any agentThe latest guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) acknowledge this limitation and recommend against offering any CIPN-preventive drug to patients undergoing neurotoxic cancer treatmentOptimize/correct co-existing risk factors for neuropathy prior to initiating neurotoxic chemotherapy (HbA1C, B12/B1 deficiency, B6 intoxication, thyroid abnormalities)Cryotherapy is showing promising results for preventing CIPN from paclitaxelEducate patients against unnecessary use of vitamin supplements (especially B6)4. I provided them with this info regarding the MUGA tests for detecting early cardiotoxicity and they said that they only do MUGA's (COH specialist said that their cardiologists do not allow them to use MUGA tests and they always use echocardiographs):\"Cardiac monitoring in HER2-positive patients on trastuzumab treatment: A review and implications for clinical practice\"https://www.thebreastonline.com/arti...jbs_etoc_emailHighlights• Current MUGA is not sensitive and reliable enough to detect cardiotoxicity early.• 3DE (with STE) is most suitable for cardiac monitoring of patients on trastuzumab.•The optimal frequency and duration of cardiac monitoring is not yet established.• MPO and hs-troponin are promising biomarkers to detect cardiotoxicity.AbstractTrastuzumab prolongs progression-free and overall survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer. However, trastuzumab treatment is hampered by cardiotoxicity, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline with a reported incidence ranging from 3 to 27% depending on variable factors. Early identification of patients at increased risk of trastuzumab-induced myocardial damage is of great importance to prevent deterioration to irreversible cardiotoxicity. Although current cardiac monitoring with multi gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning and/or conventional 2D-echocardiography (2DE) have a high availability, their reproducibility are modest, and more sensitive and reliable techniques are needed such as 3D-echocardiography (3DE) and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE). But which other diagnostic imaging modalities are available for patients before and during trastuzumab treatment? In addition, what is the optimal frequency and duration of cardiac monitoring? At last, which biomarker monitoring strategies are currently available for the identification of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with trastuzumab?I plan to switch to a PPO in Nov during open enrollment but will have to live with Kaiser till Jan when the new plan begins. It is just too frustrating fighting for everything.",

        "There is a 2015 article  that examines the difference in efficacy and side effects between Taxotere and Taxol titled \"Balancing activity and tolerability of neoadjuvant paclitaxel- and docetaxel-based chemotherapy for HER2-positive early stage breast cancer: Sensitivity analysis of randomized trials\".  I  don't know if the study is considered good evidence or not.In the end, I chose Taxotere (which followed an anthracycline) over Taxol.  Taxotere carries a greater risk of permanent hair loss, while Taxol puts the patient at risk of neuropathy (neurotoxicity).  I figured that I would rather be permanently bald than in permanent pain.   My mother developed permanent neuropathy from Taxol and she really suffers from it. Here is the abstract (if anyone wants the rest of the article, please PM me):\"Paclitaxel and docetaxel represent the most adopted taxanes in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Questions still remain with regard to their difference in terms of activity and tolerability. Events for pathological complete response (pCR), severe and febrile neutropenia (FN), and severe neurotoxicity were pooled by adopting a fixed- and random-effect model. A sensitivity analysis to test for the interaction between paclitaxel and docetaxel was accomplished. Absolute differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the number of patients needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) were calculated to derive the Likelihood of being Helped or Harmed (LHH). Data from 15 trials (3601 patients) were included. Paclitaxel significantly increases pCR rate by 6.8% in comparison with docetaxel (43.4%, 95% CI 41.1–45.7% versus 36.6%, 95% CI 34.3–39.0%, p = 0.0001), regardless of the chemotherapy backbone, with an absolute difference of 9% and 9.2% for anthracy- cline-based or free-regimens. Paclitaxel significantly improves pCR versus docetaxel with a single HER2-inhibition by 6.7% (p = 0.0012), with no difference if combined with a dual HER2-inhibition. Severe neutropenia and FN are significantly lower with paclitaxel, with an absolute difference of 32.4% (p < 0.0001) and 2.5% (p = 0.0059), respectively. Conversely, severe neurotoxicity is slightly higher with paclitaxel (3%, p = 0.0001). The LHH ratio calculated for pCR and severe neutropenia is 2.0 and 0.7 for pac- litaxel and docetaxel. Although the activity of neoadjuvant paclitaxel and docetaxel HER2-positive breast cancer is considered similar, the slight advantage in pCR, the significantly lower neutropenia and FN, do favor paclitaxel (in the weekly fashion) over docetaxel, despite the slightly worst neurotoxicity.\"",
        "I am in your exact same place.  I have hormone positive her 2 negative bc and went through the lumpectomy and radiation easily and with flying colors.  But my first aromatase inhibitor trial was horrible as I had every side effect possible so they took me off and put me on another generic exemestane (brand name aromasin) which went well for almost a month then I had a severe depressive disorder.  So they took me off of that and at my request they put me on the brand Aromasin which hypothetically should be the same as exemestane generic but totally the opposite.  I have had fatigue which is the only notable side effect and the fatigue is managed well by drinking tons of water and exercising which my onco insisted on.  Really great advice.  I'll keep you updated and you keep us updated.  I think we all need to support each others choices as well as participate in the solution by sharing our experiences in a meaningful and truthful way!",

        "I just found out I was misdiagnosed at the biopsy stage. The test results from the biopsy showed triple positive, with a HER2 of +3, and my oncologist started me right in on neoadjuvant chemo of Herceptin, Perjeta and Taxotere, which I finished and then had a mastectomy of my left breast. My surgeon also removed all of my lymph nodes on the left side of my arm. During surgery, however, the analysis of the cancer that had gone into one of my lymph nodes tested HER2 negative. The original biopsy test was performed at a diagnostic center close to my home, but I was sent to another hospital in a larger city. This hospital has an excellent reputation and I felt very comfortable in their care. When I was told about the discrepancy, I asked my oncologist to re-test the original biopsy (the term for that material is \"blocks\") and he said he would, but was not super excited about it. My breast surgeon, however, was on it immediately and also sent all samples to an independent lab for confirmation. The results showed that the original biopsy was incorrectly diagnosed. They mistakenly found the IHC test to be +3 (on the most positive side of the scale) so they skipped the FISH test. If they had done the FISH test, they would have questioned the IHC test. Unfortunately, no one along the line questioned the HER2 +3 diagnosis without a FISH test and I had an unnecessary round of chemo. I am now looking at a new round of 2 months of bi-weekly chemo for the correct diagnosis, followed by 5 weeks of radiation, 5 days per week. Given my correct diagnosis, I should have had surgery first and then chemo, followed by the radiation. Moral of the story: Get a second opinion of the biopsy to confirm breast cancer sub-type. I would never have imagined this possibility when first diagnosed, as the concept of breast cancer was so daunting. I hope this helps someone.",

        "Hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but your friend is very, very mistaken and has been sold a bill of goods.  Yes, the concept of “transfer factors” (substances taken from people with a strong immunity to certain conditions and given to patients with those conditions who have weak immune systems) has been studied for awhile and is still in the experimental stages--but no reputable clinical trials exist for it in the breast cancer setting.  And the way they are administered is by injection or infusion. “4life Transfer Factor” is NOT one of those being studied:  it’s an unregulated nutritional supplement, and G-d knows what’s really in it. Sorry, but it’s essentially \"snake oil,\" no better than those laetrile, sheep cells, and other what-have you bulls--t substances that have given countless patients false hope and caused them to abandon proven treatments that might have given them many, many years of cancer-free living or at least some meaningful remission..There is no “cure” yet for breast cancer, only treatments that can achieve very long-term cancer-free status (“NED,” or “no evidence of disease”), to the point where many patients live out a normal-length lifespan. You say despite your mom’s chemo she is showing “no improvement.” That’s not how breast cancer, nor its treatment, works. The cancer cells aren’t making her feel sick but they are making her ill nonetheless. The whole point is to kill the cancer cells before they do any damage. Chemo is like breaking eggs to make an omelet--there are side effects that are tough to take (especially if your loved ones are going through it). You don’t see “improvement,” only no recurrence or spread. Your mom will get better but first it’s going to be rough going for her for awhile. Those side effects are actually evidence that the cancer cells are being destroyed by the chemo and \"targeted therapies.\"  HER2-neu-positive cancers are also treated with injections of Herceptin or Perjeta, drugs that are “targeted\" to affect just those tumor cells.  Your mom’s condition will slowly improve after treatment is over, but it’s really scary to watch her suffer when you think you can’t do anything about it.Ah, but you CAN. You can reassure her, be there for her, do for her, help her through the side effects and tell her to hang in there. There are things like meditation, acupuncture, yoga, aromatherapy, etc. that can help her cope with the side effects--but they have to be coordinated with the care she’s getting from her cancer doctors to make sure they’re safe for her. But don’t suggest she take some phoney-baloney over-the-counter unregulated and unproven “cure,” especially if it can interfere with her chemo and targeted therapies or, worse, she takes it instead of chemo and targeted therapy.  Don’t fall for that load of bulls--t, and don’t let your mom take it.  And it sounds cavalier to say this, but please be patient with her progress.",
