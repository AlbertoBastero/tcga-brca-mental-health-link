        "Hi everyone,  I found the lump in my breast on Sept. 29 and since then it feels like a whirlwind in my life.  Tests and dr visits and labs.  oh my.I am stage 1 but triple negative and grade 3.  So we started with chemo before anything else.  I started AC on November 16.  The first 5 days were pretty uncomfortable.  Some side effects,  but mainly just really tired.Felt wonderful for Thanksgiving.  But now that my next treatment is looming I am starting to feel anxious.I hope you all are doing well and I am hoping to make it through the chemo.  I tell my husband that the cure seems worse than the disease! But after one treatment I can barely feel the lump in my breast so I guess it is working!!!",

I‚Äôm nervous because my lymph nodes were matted.  Prior to surgery, they weren‚Äôt at all concerned about my lymph nodes on imaging.  I understand that matting can be caused by things other than cancer.  But I also know it can mean that cancer is in your nodes.  Trying to be patient.

        "Hi there.  I'm probably jumping in too late to be helpful, but I just had a lumpectomy and my surgeon used biozorb.  Benefits are that it fills the cavity from the tumor, giving a better cosmetic result, and it helps the oncologist with radiation placement later.  I've had no bad effects and am happy with it.I'm also stage 1 and about to start 3 weeks of radiation.  Partial breast radiation was not an option for me because there was a tiny second tumor next to the primary one.Happy to answer questions if anyone is currently looking for help.",
        "No, tamoxifen does not prevent mets for everyone -- there is no silver bullet (yet?) for early stage BC or MBC.  As you can tell from the thousands of posts on this site, everyone has different experiences with all the different treatments.  Tamoxifen can work for many people, but again, it does not work for everyone and is not a guarantee against MBC.  When I was diagnosed with early stage BC, I was stage 1, clear margins after lumpectomy, no node involvement, and had an extremely low oncotype score. My MO put me on tamoxifen, and we both expected a good outcome.  A year and a half later, I was not feeling well so my internist sent me for a PET scan -- I lit up like a Christmas tree -- extensive bone and liver mets.  My MO was as shocked as I was.  I say all this not to scare you but to provide a realistic response to your question.",
        "This is so reassuring to me! I wasn‚Äôt sure it was a side effect because I take it at night, so thought I should be more tired in the morning than afternoons. Your comment about never napping is the same for me. I would like to have been able to sleep during the day in the last 20 years, but that only happened when I had the flu, lol! I was looking at a career that would require me to be ‚Äúon‚Äù in the afternoons and evenings, but I second guessed my ability to perform based on how I feel now. It feels kind of wrong to say med side effects play a part in career decisions, especially since I was just stage 1. I will definitely contact my MO about trying some different tactics. Thank you",
        "When I used the online calculator given my stats (my age, Stage 1 cancer, low grade, etc.)..taking tamoxifen decreases my risk of recurrence by a miniscule amount. Am I really supposed to deal with the side effects and having something f** with my body like that, just to reduce my risk of recurrence from an already low percentage? No thanks. I'd rather look into serious lifestyle changes instead.Reading this great book \"What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Breast Cancer.\" In the UK, they did a trial to see why ER+/PR+ women do better..live longer, etc..they discovered that Progesterone acts as a braking mechanism for the growth of ER+ tumors. They injected women with progesterone only and saw their tumors shrank significantly.So why aren't doctors doing clinical trials HERE of treating women with progesterone? Hmmm..could it be the money incentive in prescribing meds that actually end up harming them?I'm grateful nobody is gonna push me into chemo or rads, because I'm stage 1, no nodes...but even if I wasn't, I would think long and hard about taking a cure that actually comes close to killing the patient...so many people do chemo and die anyway.I'd honestly rather have a shorter life with a higher quality, but I think according to the calculator I used, Tamoxifen would give me 1.5 extra yrs of survival. My cancer untreated (and that's without surgery or anything. I DID surgery and my dr got it all), shortens my life by 4 yrs. (from 32 years to 28 years..big whoop. I'm ok with dying at 78, honestly, if my QOL is good). Tamoxifen shortens THAT to 2.8 years. Big whoop.",

        "I just had my unilateral mastectomy a little over a week ago and have decided already to opt out.I'm stage 1, no nodes. I guess I get why people who already have a low risk of recurrence want to lower it even further..if, as in my case, it would probably only be from an 8 pct risk to a 4 pct risk. But that's not me. I'd rather have less really good years in good health than way more years dealing with side effects.And I guarantee I'd be one of the ones to get SEs as I always do. SEs and allergic reactions.I'd rather do my homework on everything else that cuts my recurrence--like, for ex, eating 5 or more fruits or veggies per day and exercising for 30 minutes 6 times a week (this was shown in an actual study to lower risk of recurrence by 20 pct or more), even if it is more work than letting an oncologist convince me to pop a pill.",
        "So, in 2019 i was diagnosed with IDC stage 1 grade 1 1cm...lumpectomy, radiation arimidex....in 2008 I had a mammogram that showed calcifications...I had a biopsy....pathology said targeted calcifications, lesion is suspicious for dcis...then final diagnosis said FEA with asscociated calcs...with a note that said FAE borders on ADH, an excision should be considered to fully evaluate...there was also an addendum that said additional level sections were obtained and demonstrate the atypia to a better advantage and a diagnosis of ADH bordering on low grade dcis is favored...an excision is recommended....I had the excision and the final pathology said focal flat epithelial atypia....my question is this....how could they think it could have been dcis and it turn out to be just FEA?...i did not take tamoxifen after this ...could they have missed this?  because 10 years later It turned out that i had small amt of dcis with my IDC....im worried that I could have had more disease in me the whole time between both diagnosis..thanks",

My Gyn and One, said it was alright to take vaginal Premarin cream to help with uterine wall problems.

        "At 44 years old in 2008 I was dx stage 1 node negative IDC, clear margins from lumpectomy + rads, oncotype of 23 and 6 months of CMF chemo. PLUS 7 years of femara.  I was told the treatment and 7 years femara gave me a recurrence % of around 8%.  I was taken off of femara (after 7 years which was longer than the standard of care) as my top rated NCI cancer ctr told me my risk of bone loss was greater than my risk of recurrence.  I have no family history and do not have BRCA.  Imagine my surprise when 11 years later, I had a recurrence, stage IV.  It was discovered fairly early but there is no early stage IV distinction, really.  I have been on treatment for 3.5 years and have had no evidence of disease for almost 3 of those years so I am doing well.  I have been told by many oncologists that this should not have happened, but here I am. Stage IV, even when you are doing well on treatment is a terrible reality. My reality and my opinion is the oncologists don't really know everything and I do believe 30% of early stage will have a recurrence and not a local recurrence.   I did all I could to reduce my risk and still ended up stage IV.   Plenty of people have reasons to not take an Aromatase Inhibitor but I would caution you all to seek a second opinion.  I sure wish I had stayed on femara past 10 years but didn't seek a second opinion because with node negative disease and the treatment I completed, I felt like 7 years of femara was plenty as I had remained cancer free.",

        "Dear Ladies, I've been in and out of doctors trying to see whats best for me. I was considered stage 1 DCIS on my right breast, and my lymph nodes were not effected. I had surgeries to remove the cancer, then radiaton for 9 wks and prescribed Tamoxifen.  Have been on this for almost a year in September. I've had horrible side effects and taking effexor, my oncologist doesn't seem to put a priority on my worries and questions. He's always threatening me of chemotherapy if i stop the hormone therapy. I'm just exhausted. I see the high percentage of death if i quit tamoxifen. But i would like to educate myself it there's another treatment that can benefit me. In June i was clear of any nodes in my lung and left breast (in April some cancer nodes showed in a mri) which I thank God constantly for, I just want to know if i should get blood work done, and how often to make sure my body is taking the tamoxifen, or if i should be paying attention to all the side effects i'm getting. Again, i haven't seen my oncologist for almost a year now and every time i call it seems like i'm a bother since i'm in no real danger any more. Please guide me if i should be worried or not.",
        "I know there are a lot of posts around tamoxifen. I've been on it for a year and I feel like I should feel lucky because I don't have a lot of the long list of side effects. However, I do have severe depression that started after maybe a month of being on it. I went off after 3 months to see if it really was the tamoxifen and started feeling better after a month. Went back on but this time with effexor. Effexor was a miracle drug (it even helps me sleep after years of struggling to sleep). But then the effexor stopped working and the depression took over again (still sleeping though so that's a win!). So now I'm on supplements that are helping the effexor work. But I'm struggling with my will‚Ä¶ I went from no pills to an extraordinary number of pills everyday. It's forcing me to eat when I'm not hungry so I don't puke. I'm frustrated. I'm only 44 and I feel old. And cranky. Do I have the right to complain? I need some sympathy or camaraderie or something. I want to quit it. I haven't taken it now for two days. I rationalize that I was only stage 1. I think my risk isn't reduced by too much by taking it. I don't know. Encouragement? Someone to kick my butt to start taking it again?",
        "My situation has several differences, but also a few similarities to yours.  In case it helps, here is my story:My lumpectomy removed a tumor that was 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.2 with clear margins and my lymph node did NOT have cancer.  I am stage I.  My tumor turned out to be a mix of IDC and DCIS (which is sort of like pre-cancer and is stage 0)My surgeon said I was not going to need chemo.  The first radiation oncologist I saw said I would not need chemo, but that she couldn't start radiation until the medical oncologist said it was OK.  I opted not to go with this radiation oncologist since she didn't do \"breath holding\" or any other measures to protect my heart.  I had also made appointments with radiation and medical oncologists w/ MD Anderson.  I went to the first medical oncologist appt and she said I might need chemo and ordered the oncotype test.  She said the results would take 2 weeks, but got them in about 10 days.  But while I was waiting . . . I had my second rad onc visit.  Before my appointment she had the 77 slides from my surgery \"re-read\" - the re-reading changed my grade from 2 to 3, found lymphovascular invasion that the first pathology report didn't report and also found one area of DCIS that only had 2 mm clear margins.  I really liked her and said I definitely wanted to go with her.   She did not think I would need chemo so said she would ask the med onc there (this was before my scheduled appt w/ him) if I could go ahead and start radiation.  So, I was marked up for radiation and ready to start.  I met with the medical oncologist the same day as my first radiation treatment.  He actually hesitated and considered holding off on radiation, but then said I could go ahead and start and that I could do chemo afterwards if needed.Then the day of my 3rd radiation treatment, the first med onc calls and says my score is \"quite high\" and that I needed chemo.  I freaked out.  It took me several hours to get my actual score / report.  Once I got the report, then came the reading and researching.  Turns out that my score is 29 which gives me an 18% chance of distant recurrence if I do the 5 years of hormone therapy.  Age matters - under 50 or over 50.  I am 61, so over 50.  What I wrote to some friends that night was:RS score is 1 to 100 although I don't think I've heard of anyone having less than 9 or as high as 100. Using this score and age, they figure out chance of getting cancer again if I take the hormone blocker type pills. Using this score, but ignoring age, they figure out how much doing chemo will help (sort of). For people over age 50, a score of 25 or below has no real benefit to doing chemo. For those under age 50, the benefit for those with a score of 15 & under have no real benefit, those with score of 16 - 20 have 1.6% benefit and those with score of 21 - 25 have 6.5% benefit of doing chemo. Now the confusing part - the box that says Absolute Chemotherapy Benefit says RS 26 - 100 All Ages and the number is > 15% At first glance, it would appear that there is a 15% reduction (or more) in chance of distant recurrence if I do chemo . . . but . . . reading the \"fine print\": On the front it shows that the chemotherapy benefit for scores 0 - 15 is the same no matter the age. Then for scores 16 - 25 the benefit is much greater for patients age 50 and under. I am 61. For scores 26 - 100 they both just say > 15% Looking at the 2nd page it goes into the two studies and the results of these studies. It says \"The magnitude of the absolute benefit of chemotherapy was ~ 6% at RS 26, and increased as the RS results increased from 26-100, with an average absolute benefit of ~ 24% and a conservative estimate of > 15% based on the width of the confidence intervals.\" Reading the above, it seems to say that at RS 26, the benefit is 6% and the average of the benefit from RS 26 to RS 100 is 24%. The > 15% on the report is based on the study of all people from 26 - 100 and is NOT the benefit for someone with RS 29. If the benefit increases flat line, then the benefit to me at RS 29 would be about 7 1/2% so my chance of distant recurrence is 18% if I don't do chemo and 10 1/2% if I do chemo.  Also, given that the benefit for those over 50 years is less than the benefit for those 50 or under when the oncotype score is under 26, it would seem that the benefit for those over 50 would also be less for higher oncotype scores which would mean my benefit would be less than 7.5% Sorry the above was so long, but wanted you to see the though process and also know ahead of time that if your score is above 25, the \"> 15%\" benefit from chemo may or may not be real.Since then, I've done more reading and research and was able to find a site that had a graph showing approx chance of recurrence with and without chemo for the various oncotype scores.  I also found a booklet that said that 26 - 30 might not be advised to do chemo depending on other circumstances.I did meet with the second med onc again and he does want me to do chemo after I finish radiation.  He did say that he understands if I choose not to do radiation.  I am 75% through w/ radiation now and only have the 5 boosts left to go.  I have until July 26th to decide if I will or will not do chemo.As of right now, I am planning to skip chemo but will start the hormone therapy and do other things to hopefully reduce my risk of distant recurrence like exercise and maintaining a healthy weight.",
        "I was premenopausal when I was diagnosed with Stage 1, grade 1, highly HR+, HER2 - breast cancer 4 years ago. Yesterday, my MO said I could be nearing the end of the hormone therapy, but she gave me two options. 1. Continue on Tamoxifen for 1 more year in order to complete 5 years of treatment and then stop or 2. Switch now to an AI (I have since become menopausal, could be age or could be the tamox but my doc said now am considered post meno) and continue with that until reaching 7 years of treatment.  She said that either option is reasonable given my favorable stats and that I have tolerated Tamoxifen well.  I am a thin woman with Osteoperosis in my family, so a little concerned about bone loss on and AI. My lifestyle factors are all great, exercise, eat right, sleep well, etc. Anyone else faced with a similar decision?  What did you choose? Or even if you don't face this decision, I'd love to hear peoples thoughts. Thank you.",

        "Hi Everyone,I was diagnosed with TNBC stage 2 in Feb and have undergone neoadjuvent (chemo + immunotherapy) with 11 rounds taxol weekly and 3 rounds of cisplatin and keytruda. But since week 7 I‚Äôve developed side effects to the immunotherapy. My heart rate elevated, I got breathe less, low grade fever of up to 100.5 daily and headaches. Then I developed anemia (RBC 8.2) requiring a blood transfusion, thyroditis with TSH falling as low as 0.01 and impacted liver function indicators with ASL as high as 115. Some of these symptoms were brought under control as I skipped the last round of keytruda and started low grade daily steroids regime. But now I‚Äôm discussing the next phase of treatment with on MO and I‚Äôm very concerned with continuing immunotherapy. According to keynote 522 trial, keytruda +AC is the next phase of treatment for 3 months - but I am very worried about the long term impact of these immunotherapy side effects. Due to shrinkage of tumor (felt through physical exam) MO is considering skipping this next phase and proceeding with surgery + radiation. But from everything I‚Äôve read seems like immunotherapy is the magic bullet for TNBC and I‚Äôm now very concerned about recurrence. Did anyone else experience these side effects and discontinue immunotherapy? What was your experience with either continuing with constant medical intervention or skipping - please share?",
        "I was diagnosed with stage II, grade III TNBC in early February 2023 and started chemo (Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Keytruda followed by Cyclophosphamide + Doxorubicin + Keytruda) on April 6, 2023 after a long and fruitless attempt to be in the iSpy trial.  Had a lumpectomy/lymph node dissection on October 6th with an all clear pathology report following. Three days after surgery, I had a mild rash on my back and shoulders which my oncologist attributed to Keytruda. The rash resolved after a week and on October 20th, I had my first adjuvant Keytruda infusion. On November 6th, I began getting an itchy rash on my hands and my right wrist and hand were swollen and painful. I reported these first to the surgeon's office and they reported it to the oncologist. With a week, my hands were covered in blisters. I self-referred to a dermatologist who identified the rash as pustular psoriasis and the joint pain as psoriatic arthritis. I've been on high and then medium dose prednisone ever since. I've tapered down to 30mg of prednisone but have joint swelling in my knee, thumb and wrist. My oncologist stopped Keytruda and we're still trying to sort out how I get on with my life.I found this interesting article this evening.

Do they have a portal for patients that you can message on?  There has got be be something for you, the DR.s just need to reason it out.More info on me is below......not a help for you likely, but a story.As to supplements, my med team were cautious of me adding anything besides the D and C i was taking. I followed the recommended dosage on the bottle- Costco orange C-Gummies! I also eat 2 oranges a day.After my surgery and chemo being 1.5 months back, I asked if i could add any supplements. I message them i would add citrical- which my nurse friend mentioned- Calcium, magnesium and some other items.  When i went to see my MO Friday, i asked her if i am able to add anything for the missing estrogen? She said nothing new for now. Why? I was just starting my first dose of Herceptin and Pejjeta.  My HER2 + histology from my tumor got be new directives. My case is odd. She took me to their \"tumor round table\" of Dr's. to see what they suggest for me. These 2 sets of infusions is it. I am currently a Stage 2, no metastasizing with a mastectomy removing the tumor.I walk my 10.000 steps daily. I also started a stretching routine from my mastectomy s assigned occupational department. I go in next week and am going to ask for more suggestions. They may just provide without asking!!For food, i ate some of my favorites i was unable to eat during chemo.   Daily i am back to my Trader Joes Greek yogurt with rasp and blueberries. A dash of whip cream to mix. 1/4 cup. Salad every day as a meal. Butter lettuce and Spinach and 2 tbls of dressing.  I add nuts and \"Bagel Seasoning\" for extra tast. Low cal cheese. Keep calories low, but taste high. Tomatoes, bell peppers. I also keep the pre packaged bags i get from Sams club. I just add spinach and use less dressing.I crock pot chicken that i shred to add to stuff all week. I just bought Talapia i plan to cook a few days this week.Above all else is water!!! Since Chemo, i have worked to drink half my body weight.  Coffee in the morning does not count. This is probably most important.As to reconstruction surgery, it was not for me. My breast area is still partially numb. The pain killers at surgery time helped a few days, and today 7 weeks out i have little pain. I truly believe it was the skill of the breast surgeons and team and the platcic surgeon and his team who did their jobs right. My body did its thing and heeled. No, we will be cutting that breast open again in the same spot to implant the implant and remove the expander. The surgeons will do their job. What about my body?  For today, I will not worry.Attitude is our key to so much. Ask questions, tell them what is not working, and what is. They cannot help if they do not know.",
        "I must say mine was 5cm, and fast growing. That is why i had the neo-adjuvant to shrink the tumor for better margins. 13rounds of chemo of3 types and it shrunk 1/2, barely. Because of covid, my surgery was moved back 1 month. In 2 months, it was growing again. The team needs to fit the treatment to your results. I was stage 2 as well. My oncologist talked roundtable with other oncologists. For me, I got Herceptin/Perjeta infusions 18 times every 3 weeks. I got treatments proven to help in metastatic cases.As to research studies, I was offered one this past April to prevent GVHD for my bone marrow transplant. Others had done the early stages of using this drug. I was one of 20 at COH using it for 60 or 90 days. I got it 90 days. So far at 134 days after transplant, no GVHD.  YOU MAKE the choice.  My DR. did not insist i join the research study.  He gave me the information, explained it and let me make the choice.  I had real results I could see as a possibility. What would yours be?  Those cancers cells and tumor are not our friends.",
        "My previous post raises the question of why as a BLBC patient I am taking letrozole to start with.  This is because some of the studies about BLBC apparently dealt with Stage IV and I am Stage II.  So the thinking was  maybe, just maybe, letrozole would have some protective property for me and I might as well throw the kitchen sink at my cancer.  Not much is known about my kind of cancer. If my understanding is correct about 15% of ductal cancer is TNBC and of that 15% about 25% are BLBC with estrogen positive -- i.e., less than 4%.  So bottom line: might as well take it and hope for the best.  Polly",

        "Hello group, I was born with spina bifina and it is a spinal cord defect. I was diagnosed with stage 2 invasive carcinoma and in my mammogram shown no signs of node involvement but when they did the surgery, there was traces of cancer cells in 2 of the nodes and took out 23 more nodes with no traces of cancer in them - that was in August 2019. And had my first chemo on November 18th, 2019 and since then life has been very hard. While the surgery to remove my right breast was easy. I had 2 chemo drug reactions that eat the first and second layers off the back of my left thigh and will not let my nephrostomy tube stay in place for more than 20 days. For those that don't know, they are usually replaced every 90 days I've had about 12 nephrostomy tube replacements since November 25th. I am terrify to start hormone pill therapy because most medical oncologist haven't treated someone like me before and they are in uncharted areas. I am 42 years young and I will tell you, I am sorry that I ever took that dose of chemo. I was told prior that with just taking radiation I had an 83% of being cured and with chemo it raised it to 93%.  I had thought about getting my ovaries removed to help lower the estrogen in my body. I would appreciate any comments, or suggestions you may have. Thanks for reading",
        "I am a BRCA2 women and small breasted, so my tumor gave me two choices. My friend did not have reconstruction. She is stage 4. I am stage 2.  My City of Hope doctors said i was a candidate for reconstruction. Oddly, we did not cover more than two types. Likely cause i was staying my same size. No upper cup sizes for me. I got skin sparing. By gosh if i did not have my nipple area gone, both look the same. My right will go once my blood clot is gone. I really did not know which i wanted, but what am getting works and my doctor did a good job. Honestly, I never had the thought i cannot lose my breast. I have cried after i got the one removed, knowing the other would go too. And the last person likely to touch my remaining one is my plastic surgeon. For me, if this will cut my chance for reoccurrence down, I will do it.  Having reconstruction makes me feel good. With cancer treatments, that is good.",
        "I'm not a doctor, so I can't give you medical advice, but my understanding is that Herceptin alone is only for small, stage 1 cancers.

As of now, they say my lymph nodes are clear and are recommending immediate reconstruction with implants ( I am not a candidate for DIEP flap). My concern is whether I need radiation after I don't want to ruin the implants or have capsular contracture. The plastic surgeon is telling me everything will be okay. The oncologist is telling me to wait and get the expanders.  I am also waiting on my PET scan results, and hopefully, that will give me more of an idea about treatment after. Anyway, has anyone successfully had implants that were not ruined by radiation? I just am not sure which way to go.  Any help or experience either way would help make my decision.

        "I'm sorry your wife has to go through all this. She was very conservative in removing both breasts. Also, LCIS has considered Stage 0. Doctors go by the book, and nowadays, the guideline says she can take anti-hormonal treatment. If I was in her position, I wouldn't. These meds have side effects even if you don't have them right away. No one can tell us what SE will be in 20-30 years. Also, depends on your wife's situation, how old is she, do you have young children, and how is her general health. I take my medication because I am Stage II, with young children. Her situation may be different.",

        "Hi! I'm scheduled for a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction with expanders on October 9th, October 8th for Sentinal Lymph Node biopsy.  I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer on September 9th. A lump on my bottom right side which thank fully is contained.  I noticed the lump in April, but am prone to getting cysts, so I didn't think anything of it.  It wasn't going away and was actually getting bigger.  Due to covid lockdowns, I couldn't get in to see my family doctor and was terrified to go to emerg, no thanks to my anxiety.  Mid july I showed it to my sister, who is a nurse, who then encouraged me to get it checked out.  I finally went August 14th, was immediately booked at the Breast Clinic for the 20th and had my biopsy on the 25th.  Needless to say, September has been the loooooongest month ever.   Removing both was a no brainer for me and will help alleviate any further anxiety of a lifetime of testing.  I found this forum a few days ago, but was hesitant to join.

        "When I was first diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer I saw a MO in Thailand at Bumrungrad Hospital, one of the best in Asia. MO there said:  \"4 cycles are adequate, anything over 4 provided very little benefit\". Since I lived in the Philippines I decided to do my Chemo at Makati Medical Center in Manila. The MO there stated she preferred 6 cycles. Even after that I sought a third opinion at a hospital closer to my home and MO stated 8 cycles. So I proceeded with 6 cycles, at the end of four I could take no more. I stopped and proceeded to radiation treatment. Since then I returned to Bumrungrad Hospital and the MO restated 4 cycles was adequate and referred me to this Web Site, it is fairly technical: http://www.anco-online.org/Majure2016.pdf.  Refer to Abstract 2 starting on page 7. Note second slide titled, Background with the following line: At a median f/u of 7 years, TC x 4 was superior to AC x 4 (Jones, JCO 2009). X 4 stands for 4 cycles.

        "I'm new. I had surgery 12/23 when they discovered a lobular cancer mass (8cm) in left breast. Last mammogram 7/22 showed 0, except for a ruptured implant, which is why the replacement surgery. In surgery, both were ruptured after many years. Since surgery, I get chills hourly. First ONC visit, she gave me Letrozole, which only increased hot flashes and chills. Lobular cancer is fed by hormones. Doc removed the mass in surgery, and shaved nodes from my ribs and chest wall. After many tests, including a PET scan, it only appears up to the chest wall, but no where else. Nothing in breasts. I found that Abemaciclib (although prescribed) wasn't avail bec Lilly holds a 7-yr patent, so no one else can make the generic until after that. Verzenio was $22k, so I filed for a hardship since I am retired at 75. Lilly sends it free. I stopped hormone gel, and hot flashes increased from Letrozole. I can live with that. After a UTI and antibiotics, on 4/25, I started Verzenio, which caused diarrhea on day 3 that was helped by reg Imodium. Today is day 8 of Verzenio. I also take Zofran 30 minutes before, which mostly helps nausea, but still need MS Imodium to ease cramps that continue, and I just don't feel good. Guess what you all call fatigue is when I walk across the house, I'm out of breath, and must sit 5 min so I can continue. I thought it was dizziness from lack of normal food, as I had to limit many of my normal items. I've lost 4 lbs which is a bonus, but feeling crappy doesn't help. I ordered Multi-symptom Imodium which seems to be what everyone is using to assist with cramping. My stomach is seldom happy. I've avoided dairy, fast food (helps avoid cooking, but doesn't help tummy), and fiber (needed to avoid constipation). My biggest challenge is finding that balance. Think I'm going back to Metamucil and MS Imodium. Seems like diarrhea happens every other day, but minimal. I get 0 warning, and can't make it 4 feet to restroom. After many accidents, I decided to find a balance between these 2 to ease my mind and be comfortable. I am currently feeling confined to home. Don't know how you folks work every day! I commend you. Verzenio also can cause blood clots. I had a stroke in 2007, so I already take a baby aspirin daily for that. My neurologist feels that can also help avoid clots. I am concerned, but this is what I take, and if I stop Verzenio, I am looking at months, according to the ONC. I'm continuing. She said I'm Stage 3/4, and she has a patient that has had Stage 4 for 20 years, so that's hopeful. I sit mostly in my recliner under blankets. I haven't cooked or done anything. When I ask doc questions, she wants to see me, which is 60 min away, so I found you folks in the meantime. I'm not getting in the car until I have this  controlled somewhat.Mary in CA",
        "I am 7 years out from stage 2b, her2- IDC. I chose CMF instead of AC because of the long lasting side effects of AC. I also had a DXM, 14 nodes removed, radiation and 5 years of tamoxifen.

CMF was not a cake walk, but I didn‚Äôt get sick from it, just very tired, bit of brain fog and some constipation. I do not have any long lasting effects from CMF and didn‚Äôt lose my hair, which was nice. The radiations treatments were harder on me than the chemo.

        "Hi guys, I was diagnosed with stage 3 bc in February. Currently seriously considering not taking the tamoxifen and five years of zoladex I have been prescribed. I'm researching a lot and it seems based on the date that hormone treat may give me max a 10% reduction in my recurrence rate. I did AC-T chemo, had a double mastectomy and will be starting radiation soon. I am not anti-conventional medicine, I just don't think the medical team know the full story (ie no knowledge and/or appreciation for the role lifestyle and environment play in creating cancer) and this is most of an issue when it comes to hormone treatment, in my opinion.I am wondering are there many on this forum who refused hormone treatment and are still recurrence free? Please feel free to respond also if you refused hormone treatment and you did have a recurrence. My mind is open to everything relevant! I am 31 years old and my cancer was all grade 1, which will also be influencing factors in my decision I think. Looking forward to hearing from you all!",
        "Ladies I was so happy to have finally found you all.  I actually cried.  I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Multifocal Lobular Breast Cancer in Jan. of 2017.  My mastectomy went wonderfully.  Then I found out I was going to need radiation.  I had 28 treatments and was told it would take a year for my skin to heal. I was also told that implants would not be an option for me.  So I began to investigate my options, talked with several doctor friends and went to two PS.  I ended up choosing the DIEP, however after reading all of these posts, I am sure it was more of a muscle sparing TRAM.  Five days after surgery my belly button began to die.  My skin turned black and I had to have another surgery.  This time I was not cut open from hip to hip, but it was about a 10 X 4 incision.  My PS removed the umbilicus and the mesh, replaced the mesh with the Strattice mesh that melts into your abdominal wall.  The PS had to leave the wound open in case of infection and built me a new belly button.  I was in the hospital for 15 days and then 3 days of rehab.  My open wound finally healed after 8 months and all the while wearing a binder to support my abdomen.  I would swell up to an 8 month pregnant lady.   My PS had no idea why nor my family doc and my oncologist.  I was cleared to begin light exercise.  Two weeks later I develop a hernia. More surgery, more pain and more swelling.  Still continued to wear the binder.  I was seeing a PT for massage therapy and she was trying to help with the swelling too.  I have actually been seeing her ever since.  I feel good when I leave her but next day swelling back.  I have read a lot of you having issues after eating, walking etc.  Clothing not fitting, falling down below belly button.  I have not worn a pair of button jeans in three years. I battle with constipation and take probiotics and fiber daily and most weeks several laxatives.  Everything I have read on here... all the same for me.   That was why I was so happy to have found this.  I thought I was the only one.  I have had a second hernia and am still battling swelling and pain daily. My PT has me wearing \"spanks\" to try and help with the trunktal lymphodima.   I am finally having my first revision surgery to remove the dog ears, extra fat and skin and fix a small flap of extra skin.  I am also getting a lift on both sides and nipples.  I hope this is my last and then I can get the tattooing.  How disappointing for all of us to be told that we would have boobs back with a tummy tuck never knowing how bad we were damaging our guts.",

        "I was diagnosed with stage 3 estrogen positive breast cancer in 2021. Had chemo, then mastectomy, then radiotherapy.Now 3 and half years of taking Anastrozole Hormone therapy and I am beginning to struggle with stiff aching back and hip pain. I was told to take Calci-d and admittedly have not really took it as again side effects with that. My stomach feels bloated and constipation sets in. I have my 4th follow up appointment in couple of weeks and should I ask for bone density scan to see what effect the Anastrozole has had on my bones as I am scared that maybe I am on the brink of getting osteoporosis as the pain now is constant every day. I have only had one bone density scan before I started the hormone treatment in 2031 so should I have had more by now?I really don't know what to do for the best as hate all the side effects of all the treatment. A lady I met who had the same diagnosis as me has just died as her cancer kept coming back and unfortunately the chemo she had affected her liver and she died from liver failure a month ago. This scares me as it wasn't the cancer that killed her in the end but the effects of what the treatment did to her.It really is a very scary thought going forward of what is the best thing to do. Of course I am glad the cancer has gone but even after a whole years treatment I am still suffering with the effects of the hormone treatment just hoping it will keep the cancer away.I am going to try and take half of the Calci-d daily and see how I get on with that but obviously it probs won't be as effective in helping my bones. Maybe any help is too late now for my bones.Also If they offer to change my Anastrozole and I try another aromatose inhibitor I will still get other side effects and my consultant did say that Anastrozole was the best one to be on and wants me to stay on it but I don't know how much longer I can put up with the pain in my bones Without needing the help of another drug which will add further side effects.They say they want me to be on hormone treatment for 20 years, is that really necessary. I have had 3 and half years so far but I know my bone health has definitely been affected after this short time. The thought of Osteoporosis is scary also as possible  bone fractures really scare me as live alone with steep stairs so how I would manage with a fracture is unthinkable really.I just do not know what to do for the best.Tracey"

( they decided on this title- I'm not making any claims here! )  This is body mind spirit journey using detoxifying the body and mind, and spirit. it is not a religious program ! I was also featured article on  radical remission project !  My story is posted here under my name. I use Marcia Mcmahon as my guest name. I have really researched breast cancer alternatives using links to NIH, and also used essential oils. Frankincense is the most important to try! My story is also posted on the metastatic ladies share their stories stage 4 stories with Marcia M. I survived stage 4 brain mets and a crippled arms and hand that went out due to the size of the tumor. I used both traditional chemo rads and surgery and added the juicing and so much more . I grow spouts , juice and have written a free cookbook. Her e are some links for you gals. I'm well at stage 4 ! I'M 7 years out!  Iam a reiki master and certified in hypnosis. I  offer suggestions for improvements to diet ,exercise ,supplements super food and a free cookbook! I am putting out  and free radio links and article  links. Iam not into heavy marketing I only want t o help others here. Ive found that use of Mind body spirit approach addressed all underlying issues related to breast cancer more thoroughly than just doing alternative or just the traditional medical model. I have confidence that my oncologist is so impressed that he said yes to all my alternatives and to taking me off hormonal therapy! the last scan was all clear! I had very brittle bones and was at risk for spinal or foot fracture . so Ive been given a clean bill of health for now. Its Thanksgiving that is something to celebrate! Please feel free to email if you'd like a copy of the  vegan healthy diet cookbook! dl347-4287b6d5-91b8-40fa-a274-3d40901ef3ce-v2.jpegThe Transformatationshow.comhttps://thetransformationshow.com/?cookieUUID=c380...theradicalremissionproject.org/Marciadiwish you all healing and wellness!Marcia M",
        "hello dear No tamoxifen does not prevent Mets . I had a brain met most likely there during stage three treatments. I had a large met yo my brain . I did well using arimedex after brain surgery and radiation- stereotactic type .  I was stage 4 and here I am more that ten years out! I was blessed with also using vegan diet and good treatments ! I‚Äôm on Evista since I used up my time on Arimedex and needed bone growth . Now I have a large ovarian cyst . They want to remove it but I‚Äôm holding out for it to shrink . It‚Äôs benign . The Tamoxifen made me very ill and caused serious problems for me . It can cause uterine cancer . I‚Äôm hunching that Evista caused my cyst . Anything you take has side effects . You have to watch everything after you take it . Good luck Marcia",
        "Hi Shanon; Yes I do use frankincense oil combined with apricot seed oil, combined as you cannot use EO on the skin directly,  for a preventive EO. I was stage 4, and have had no recurrence. Dr. Siu in Iowa state has researched this and found it modulates breast cancer in the lab without affecting normal cells. I'm happy using it on my breasts one is gone but I use it there and on the normal breast. I  also found it made my scars disappear. it has added benefits like relaxation. I use essential oils like peppermint for stress,  use rose oil for uplifting aromatherapy. Lavender for a variety of purposes. write me if you need more information! I have quite a large collection now and love them. best MarciaM",
        "Hello Sunshine;¬†I pray that you have a sucessful eye surgery and that the arimidex was not the cause. I myself just did a google search on arimedex because I believe it is related to my eye problems wit h excessive pressure. I have had glaucoma early onset since being on chemo. I remember terrible eye burning where i would be laid up in bed unable to funtion ¬†or see and then the glaucoma set in.¬†My ¬†parents had it but not in their late fifties, I assume arimdex or chemo or tamoxifen was the cause. Sure enough-- ¬†I read a study that tamoxifen caused glaucoma in some women. You have to weigh the pros and cons. I am stage 4 but I have naturally very low estrogn and my cancer was caused by estrogen being given by doctor -- HRT. I sid no but they inisted. It was for seizures, I know how weird my luck got with this. ¬†Read everything and weigh it out. Now I am thinking of going off the arimedix but will ¬†consult my ¬†doc first. Best of luck to all here! My eye doc today suggested I use fish oil. That is migtht reduce eye pressure > i should ahve asked him about arimedex, but they would never contradict a another doctor.Marcia",
        "Wow, good to hear from you all! Sounds very exiting! I'm stage 4 - liver mets - that seem to be very aggressive at the moment. Ibrance/Faslodox (and before that Letrozole) failed me. Now moving to weekly taxol - no ending (so not a 8-round chemo). Until it stops working, onc. says. Never had any chemo before so quite scarred of the prospect. I will definitely try fasting 36-48 hours before and 24 hours after infusion. Just a little worried that it is every week - so will be kind continuous 3-4 fasting. And don't know how long this is going to be possible. Please keep writing about your experiences as you go along. And if there are stage 4 on weekly taxol out there fasting - please kick in too!",
        "My opinion is that access to internet stories give a lot of women a false sense that if they listen to their bodies, they can cure breast cancer via holistic medicine. It's sort of along the same lines as  how nowadays, some parents refuse to vaccinate their children because they feel they've read up on all the pros and cons, via the internet of course, and they believe vaccination cons outweigh the pros. And a disease once eradicated has cropped up into our population again.What happens is too many women don't consider the sources from where they get their information, how reputable it is. Where is the scientific data? I'm a big believer of tuning into our bodies, sure. But how about some honest to goodness studies of women who went the holistic route to cure their breast cancer, and ended up needing treatment because it progressed and may even have metastasized. Because no one is collecting that data. It's a case of ‚Äúoh my friend, a friend of a friend, a relative, a neighbor did this that and the  other thing and the cancer went away. Why isn't someone doing a study and gathering this information over the course of a number of years?And some of the same women shunning conventional treatment for breast cancer run to the doctor for antibiotics to clear up things like sinus infections and strep throat. Why not try curing those with holistic meds, too?I was diagnosed stage iv from the start 8 years ago and wouldn't be here now without conventional treatment. But another phenomenon I see is that more women with breast cancer metastases claim they're going for a cure, that they think they could be ‚Äúogliometastatic\" meaning since their bc traveled to only one or two places in the body, a cure is more possible. I had a long stretch of stability with the disease after initial treatment and ongoing hormonal therapy, about 8 years, so I rode the wave of enjoy it while it lasts, not oh I'm cured.Without modern medicine, we would be looking at sooo many more deaths of women from breast cancer.",
        "I have been on all three AI‚Äôs over the course of 12 years (I am stage IV). I had joint pain in quite a few areas but managed with OTC treatment. I coped quite well for a very long time (working almost that entire time as an elementary school teacher) so it wasn‚Äôt debilitating nor did it change my life much but, eventually the cumulative effect from over a decade on the drug really bothered me. The unusual part about this is that it is more common to have side effects diminish over time whereas for me it was the complete opposite. Yes, I do have osteopenia but it remains stable. Although there are known side effects to these drugs, individual reaction to them seems to vary widely. \r\nI stayed on them for 12 years because I was stage IV but had no progression after initial treatment. The reality is however, that no one really knows why I have not had progression. In November 2023, at my oncologist ‚Äòs suggestion, I stopped taking them. I am still stage IV but on no treatment whatsoever.\r\nAs far as your decision, that is entirely up to you. Many, including myself, suggest giving it a try and stopping if you experience side effects. The other thing that you might think about is how would you feel if you had a recurrence. We have members who have declined these drugs and had no recurrence as well as those who declined and did have a recurrence. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no way to predict which way it might go so you need to feel comfortable with your choice. Take care",
        "Just jumping in here. I was diagnosed stage IIIa in 2008. I was on tamoxifen 5 years then letrozole for 5+ years. I have just gotten diagnosed with a late recurrence and I‚Äôm now stage 4 with mets to the bone (and possibly other places that are unknown at this point). The first thing they did was start me on letrozole again and I‚Äôm going to be on it along with some other medications. My thought is why didn‚Äôt they just keep me on Letrozole if it‚Äôs what they were going to use when you if you move on to stage 4? I wish I never stopped it because now I will permanently be in the medical world. My oncologist is very encouraging, but I‚Äôm definitely looking at a shortened lifespan. \r\nI think I fell into the black hole where they didn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúevidence‚Äú but I‚Äôm reading now that lobular tends to have late reoccurrence. I should‚Äôve just stayed on the medicine (as for me I wasn‚Äôt having many side effects).My thought is that being 14 1/2 years out from diagnosis the doctors were wanting to say I was ‚Äúcured‚Äù but I think what the reality is is that I have always had breast cancer ‚Äúseeds‚Äù throughout my body that medication was just suppressing effectively.\r\nSorry if this isn‚Äôt what you wanna hear because of your side effects. I agree with the other poster who says to discuss lowering your dose or maybe taking a (small) break. I think my problem is a break of four years was just way too long. I know I was fine for several years and then this has come on.On the good side, after only four days of letrozole my pain from bone Mets (which I realize now that‚Äôs what I was feeling instead of paying from a fall I had), has already gotten somewhat better. So that‚Äôs my anecdotal evidence that the medication actually does do something.\r\nFood for thought! Cheers.\r\n(I never post so if you don‚Äôt see my reply, don‚Äôt assume the worst!)",
        "macdebbie,I understand what jhl  is saying and agree in some ways. However, for me, regardless of medical expertise or recommendations for treatment an important quality in an mo was that they listen to me, don‚Äôt dismiss or minimize my questions or concerns, and respect my intelligence. I have no medical background but I am reasonably intelligent and understand how to read/interpret research (Many of the same skills I use to evaluate educational research can be applied to medical research). I don‚Äôt do well with docs who are condescending, talk down to me, or have egos that interfere with my getting the best care possible.I know some folks would not care so much about these things. My own mother hated her ob/gyn but because I was born healthy she believed that she should use him for her subsequent pregnancies as that would somehow guarantee healthy babies. I need to have a doctor/patient relationship based on mutual respect and understanding of me as an individual. I am stage IV so this is going to be a lifelong relationship but I think lower stages deserve the same. Not letting you record a visit has nothing to do with you and everything to do with his ego. I have never had anyone involved in my bc care not allow a recording. There is so much info to absorb and understand that most doctors should welcome the recording as it gives you a chance to review what was said and become an informed patient. Take care.",
        "Hi @steppingstonetowhere, I am stage iv and as well as kisqali and letrozole, I use keto to help with side effects, which are so far very limited. I am allergic to the proteins and whey of dairy so I tend to really limit my intake of dairy - as much as I love dairy, it doesn't love me. I exercise on a daily basis and I think this helps - but I am very lucky, many are limited with exercise because of extreme fatigue. Also, your immune system is an issue when joining a gym and lots of members' immune systems are next to non-existent because of treatment. So joining a gym where there is a good chance of catching a virus is not an option for them.I do intermittent fasting, not as a conscious choice but because I never got back into the habit of eating dinner after I lost my appetite years ago. After I regained my appetite, I just never got into the habit of dinner. I have since lost my appetite again and so am on a reduced calorie intake - again, not by choice - I don't have the self disciple for that.I had a recent disastrous experience with probiotics and have decided after a month of taking them, that they are not an option for me on a full-time basis. The side effects were too extreme. I had previously used them on a short-term basis with antibiotics but I won't even do that again. I am careful with supplements - only vitamins B & D and a standard multi-vitamin.I discuss this with my onc and she is aware of my situation. If I want to explore a new strategy with regard to food/supplements/exercise I always discuss it with her. Good luck with your treatment.",
        "Hi,I am also stage IV with bone metastasis. I have taken all 3 AI's and am currently on Aromasin. The se'shave been the same for me on all three, but clearly not as debilitating as yours. I manage with Alleve during the day and cannabis at night. Given that I've been NED for 8 years and I can manage the pain while living a fairly normal life, I'll stick with it.Some people use a supplement called DIM. I don't think it is an equivalent to AI's but if you are miserable, it might be worth considering. Take care",
        "Unfortunately, my symptoms on all of the AI‚Äôs have never improved over time, sigh‚Ä¶ but given that I‚Äôm stage IV and these drugs have kept me progression free (at least that‚Äôs the assumptions) for over 11 years I will keep taking them and do my best to cope.",
        "Has anyone taken it? My dear, this is a breast cancer forum and letrozole is a well established drug that has been used for many, many years. Let me address ‚Äúhorror‚Äù stories. They do exist and some women have found the side effects to be intolerable. These are the folks who will post on this forum and other sites about the negative experiences they have had. Those who experience few to tolerable se‚Äôs rarely post because it‚Äôs not an issue for them. I have been on letrozole, anastrozole and Exemestane (one at a time!) fir over 11 years as I am stage IV and AI‚Äôs have been my almost sole tx. I do have some joint and bone pain which I manage and lead a fairly normal life. So while true that it becomes impossible for some to tolerate that is not the case for most. Unfortunately, there is no way to predict, in advance, how this class of drugs might affect you. I think you need to speak with your mo about why they said no AI‚Äôs earlier but are now recommending them as I think they hold the answers to that. These messages boards tend to lean heavily towards those who are having issues or side effects from treatments and/or procedures and those not having issues are sorely under represented (as most message boards of this nature do). IRL, I know many women who have or are currently taking AI‚Äôs. Most, not all, actually tolerate them well.",
        "@fighter00 Oh no this is all so new and devastating right now I know ! Please give yourself some time to digest this really tough pill to swallow. I cried a ton in the beginning also you need to release your emotions and that's ok. Have you considered meds to help deal with all this? Maybe something to take the edge off for now? You can get help from a therapist or even on this site to talk to others in the same situation. I participated in the online support group here when I was first diagnosed stage IV and it did help me. A kind woman said these simple but true words to me \" Your not dying tomorrow\" and that really got me thinking to try to live each day as a new day.I hope you are doing the biopsy today so you can at least see what you are dealing with for sure. Also there are so many new treatments that have evolved since I was first diagnosed in 2016. I know we are not curable but we do know it is treatable!

        "dh305,The genetic testing, despite a family history, is actually no surprise. Only about 15-20% of those tested are positive for known genes that increase one‚Äôs risk for breast cancer. I not only have a strong familial history of breast/reproductive cancers but I belong to an ethno/religious minority with higher than average incidences of BRCA 1. My testing? All negative. The reality is that the vast majority of bc cases are not linked to known genetic mutations.As for the decision on anti-hormonals, each person needs to evaluate not only statistical risks but their own risk tolerance. While some will say that recurrence is a crap shoot, I don‚Äôt feel that way. The stats are there but what they can‚Äôt do is predict how an individual will do . The stats are aggregate figures based on history. Since they have no individual predictive value, every person who considers taking these drugs needs to know that there is no way to determine where they will land and make their decision fully aware of the fact that there are no guarantees. It kind of stinks but that‚Äôs the current reality. Take care PS: I have been on AI‚Äôs for over 11 years but I am stage IV. I am also not typical.",

After experiencing thos side effects for about a year, I became suicidal Please reach out to your oncologist.  I take two meds to control my side effects.  For some people it is not an easy med.

I agree it's very  uncomfortable, hard, drifted high and very tight. I was warned of this but not much choice. SAt this point I am now Stage IV so I will just live with it. If it gets way worse and my cancer is holding stable I probably would just have it removed.Can't speak to surgery post rads but I think its' definitely more of a challenge although not impossible.

        "Hi Bubblebeard, There is a lot of research centered around THC/CBD causing cancer cell apoptosis.  I have estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.  I started using medical marijuana right after I was diagnosed with metastatic stage 4 cancer......over 5 years ago.  It's the only 'medicine' I use, and I am blessedly grateful for having something that has positive side effects.rather than negative side effects.And for your Rick Simpson oil, try to take the daily amount over the entire day....gently delivering the cannabinoids to your cannabinoid receptors steadily throughout the day.And if you want the most benefit your medicine has to offer, mix it with coconut oil and freeze in small nuggets that you can insert as suppositories.....you'll benefit the most from this delivery system (and because you are bypassing the digestive process, you won't ever feel high from your medicine).Take care!!",
        "I got mine out as soon as they would let me.  I found that even at my large hospital system they often wouldn't have staff who could access my port for simple labs or for mri or PET/CT contrast or tracer.  Only at the cancer center did they always have staff who could use my port.  Plus, I hated it.

        "My experience may be less relevant as it was 12 years ago. Generally referred to as one step implants, they seem to be less common than the expander route.

        "moth, I totally get it.  I work hard to keep my weight in check.  My all time high weight was in 2010 and I used an app to count calories and lost 23 pounds.  It was hard, but I did it.The last time my weight dropped was when I had pneumonia and \"couldn't eat\" - believe me, that has NEVER been a problem.  Now, my weight has crept up about 10 pounds since I was diagnosed with Stage IV and COVID started.  It's slowly coming off, but I really have to watch what I eat.I tried intermittent fasting for a day, with no results - haha.  Actually, I've been sticking with it pretty well.

        "Hi Sisters, I'll weigh in not to scare anyone but to share my experience. You can see my details in my tag below. My treatment journey should have been straightforward. I was post-meno and was given Tamox for 5 years but my journey derailed. From the beginning Tamox did not sit well with my body. Terrifying mental health effects, depression/anxiety/panic but the worst was yet to come. Five months in my belly swelled overnight, I turned yellow, my nose was bleeding I was profoundly confused (didn't know my own home) and my liver was failing. I had acute onset stage 4 cirrhosis due to a hepatotoxic response to Tamoxifen. Yup. I was told I had 3 years max to live without a transplant. Hmmmm. But with a history of cancer you can't get a cadaver liver (in Canada anyway) so that meant a live liver transplant. My sons were both a match but I wasn't up for that option. The cause (but they still don't know the full reason it happens to about 2.8% of patients) is 1. I had a fatty liver 2. Tamoxifen is a known hepatotoxin 3. Idiopathic. We just don't know. Why do 5% of women on Tamoxifen get uterine cancer and others not? But we do know that a fatty liver is an issue. You can be thin btw and have a fatty liver (me). More and more women in North America are going into BC with NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and not knowing they have it nor being checked. When you are on Tamoxifen have your liver enzymes checked monthly for 6 months. Also request a liver ultrasound. That will give you a basis of knowledge to see if you can tolerate Tamoxifen or at least see if you should consider another option. As for me, I was in intensive care 9 weeks. Due to the strictest of lifestyles I am healing. Just as they don't know why it happens to some and not others, there is not a great deal of research on outcomes for people like me. What takes a dedicated drinker 40 years to do, I managed in 5 months. Not bad for a non-drinker/smoker. Well, I have healed (sort of). Cirrhosis is generally understood as irreversible but acute onset due to a medication is not well understood. There are 4 stages of cirrhosis and I was stage 4 with a MELD score of 27 so almost too sick to face a transplant anyway. But I fought and I endured. So the scales goes Fibrosis 1-4 then you go into Cirrhosis 1-4. Through steadfast determination and compliance to diet modifications I am in Fibrosis 3. So it can happen. I am now on Letrozole as it is considered to be the least hepatotoxic of the options and I hate it. Bone pain mostly and brain fog huge. I am an academic and having brain fog is so insulting. Everyday I say 'this is the last pill I take' but I take another as it reduces the risk for me by 2%. I'm at a 12% risk (using that UK predictor tool online and discussions with my oncologist). So 10% feels better. So that's my story. Listen to your inner voice and be your own advocate. I wish I had been more demanding when Tamoxifen was running its game through my body. I knew something wasn't right but was assured by the nurse 'it's just the side effects give it 6 months and they should settle.' They didn't. And it nearly killed me.",

I am assuming after the last treatment I may have a few weeks before it comes back but I haven't found any specifics to that theory. Thanks.",
        "waves2stars,One of the harder things for many of us to reconcile with respect to bc treatment is that there are many, many unpredictable outcomes and never any guarantees. It is frustrating and for as far as we‚Äôve come with tx (I was dx‚Äôed almost 13 years ago) there is more than enough room for improvement. The human body is complicated. Breast cancer is complicated. Add to that all the potential variations in terms of not only the disease itself but how individuals can react differently to the same tx and it‚Äôs not difficult to understand how a drug can work very well for some but not for others.I am stage IV de novo. I had rads to my bone met and 12 years of one AI or the other. I have never had chemo and never had progression. Last November, my mo took me off all tx and I am, so far,fine. What caused this? No one knows, and I mean that quite literally. One of the difficult things I‚Äôve had to accept with respect to bc is that there is still much to be learned and many mysteries to be unraveled. The complexity of bc should not be underestimated. Take care"
